About me:
I am a 24 year-old aspiring tech entrepreneur trying to figure out my business model. I have a technical background: in high school I studied math hard, participated and won math competitions on the national level. Then at the university I studied maths and computer sciences, with a bigger accent in programming and machine learning. I had 2 internships in big tech companies as a deep learning engineer working with large language models. Then I worked for 2 years in algorithmic trading as a quantitative researcher and also used AI there. Right now I’m looking to build a solution to some sort of problem using AI. I also want to develop my personal brand by posting on Twitter and YouTube, sharing how to use AI tools to solve real-world problems. I have my girlfriend Anastasiia and we live together.

More details about my day-to-day life:
- I work from home only, I have a separate cabinet
- We live in a 2 bedroom apartment, so we have a living room, a cabinet for me and a master bedroom
- I try to start every day early and with the most important work, usually it’s developing an AI project or making content around it on YouTube, but sometimes my focus breaks with small routine tasks, or my work-life borders with my girlfriend are not clear enough
- I’m working out regularly, almost every day, but the time and duration of the workout fluctuates
- I always have a big stack of small, mid to low importance tasks, or they might be even highly important but routine, and I neglect them, always prioritizing them less then my main work and usually finding myself with no energy to do them and they feel like a chore
- I’m eating relatively healthy: oat meal, nuts, honey, berries, steak, eggs, bread, potato, green salad, cottage cheese, yoghurt, milk, coffee, coke, pasta, dark chocolate, …
- I’m trying to wake up at 5 am every day, but it’s tough, because I have to go to bed early. Going to bed early while living with someone else requires even more discipline
- Sometimes I struggle with addiction to social media, I can check emails/twitter/instagram/telegram sometimes too often
- Sometimes I can catch myself in self-reinforcing downwards cycle: stress + no workout + bad sleep + no sex + bad food + less productive work done
- I just relocated to Dubai after 2 years living in Amsterdam and it takes time to get used to it, to get comfortable with a new city. I’d love to work as much as I can but sometimes I have to spend time on side routine tasks
- Sometimes a can eat a snack and I deeply hate it, because my eating schedule goes broke
- Sometimes I struggle with a proper recovery, I can work too much or even have rest, but it might not be very healing. I definitely need fresh ideas on how to recover better
- I had a habit of reviewing my visualisation/affirmation board every day first thing in the morning and right before bed, but lately I wasn’t doing that and I regret it
- I struggle to chat with people regularly, I always have a ton of unread messages sent to me that feels like a chore; I ignore many of them because I can’t find time and this makes me feel miserable; I can’t find the time because I think other tasks are more priority
- I’m not consistent with doing something good for myself every day: have a coffee with a book in a cafe, have a massage, visit an ice bath, visit a sauna, … - I struggle to do it consistently
- I struggle very very much with lots of distractions; I want to remove all of them from my life
- I have to post on social media daily content about AI, but it gets hard not to scroll and watch useless stuff while I’m posting
- Producing and editing content is very hard, because I’m new to it, to make something really high quality I have to invest big time

Some things that I love:
Artificial intelligence, business, books, audiobooks, podcasts, writing code, working out, content creation, wellness procedures (ice bath, floating, cryotherapy, massage, acupuncture, infrared sauna), stretching, sport races like HYROX or runs, learning valuable skills like sales, marketing, managing people, speaking, presentation; watching  movies, travel, nature, exploring new places, eating delicious food, eating healthy food, having cool experiences with my girlfriend, trying new sports, playing chess, shopping stylish clothes, buying consultations with experts like a stylist or a nutritionist. Spending time with my parents (at least online, since we live in different countries, but preferably in real life of course). Connecting with nature, being free of all distractions.

Who I wanna become:
A legendary maestro, builder of my own thing, of my own craft. Deeply loving my craft. I don’t wanna be focused on many things, I want just select few. Intelligent, smart, experienced tech entrepreneur. Great leader. Developed sales, marketing, people management, public speaking, English speaking, presentation, content creation, personal branding skills. Huge knowledge and experience in the AI space.

Training pretty much every day, having a fixed time or situation when I do it. Reading/developing myself pretty much every day. Waking up at 5 am pretty much every day, going to bed at 8 pm pretty much every day. Eating very clean food that optimizes for longevity, never overeat. Having great relationships with my girlfriend, partners, employees. Empathic person. Millions of followers. Having a great posture. Always having a very clear and inspiring vision for my future and who I wanna be. Making $1.000.000 profit every month with my business.

How do I want to improve my life right now:
- I want to wake up at 5 am every day, and go to bed at 8:30 pm consistently
- I want to have very low amount of distractions: almost no social media, my phone turned off until 1 pm and from 6 pm, no small routine tasks in the morning
- I want to make my work more focused and untouchable, I want my girlfriend to respect it and not distract me when I’m in a deep work state
- I want to spend 80% of my time on growing my AI expertise and producing content about it; growing the expertise by 1) practicing on the real world problems, 2) learning theory, 3) talking to experts and being a part of the community
- I want to have a very clear vision of where I’m going, make it printed as a visualization/affirmation board, practice with it every day, refresh and adjust it regularly
- I want more simplicity and piece in my life: having calm time reading daily, walking, and other practices
- I want to have some regular dedicated time for solving small routine problems or implementing minor improvements in life, so basically doing other work apart from the most important business work
