About me:
I am a 24 year-old man, software engineer. I’m mostly focused on my career, and trying to balance it with a decent personal life. I live together with my girlfriend. We work from home most of the time, a have a separate room as my personal cabinet, so I can focus on my work. 

Usually my day looks like that:
- I wake up between 5 and 6:30 am (probably 1 hour before my girlfriend)
- I brush my teeth, maybe take a shower, put on clothing and then either start working or doing something else that feels right: reading a book, maybe reflecting, but eventually I start working soon
- I have a decent block of focused work (I usually work by Pomodoro and do little warm-ups between sessions, also I drink my coffee in this time)
- breakfast with my girlfriend
- more work until 12 pm
- workout at the gym and lunch until 2 pm
- more work (not that focused though, because I feel less energized compared to the morning) until 5-7 pm (also we can have a dinner at 5-7)
- if I have time I chill somehow and then start my night routine like shower, teeth, massage, setting tomorrow goals etc

Some things that I love:
Artificial intelligence, business, books, audiobooks, podcasts, writing code, working out, content creation, wellness procedures (ice bath, floating, cryotherapy, massage, acupuncture, infrared sauna), stretching, sport races like HYROX or runs, learning valuable skills like sales, marketing, managing people, speaking, presentation; watching  movies, travel, nature, exploring new places, eating delicious food, eating healthy food, having cool experiences with my girlfriend, trying new sports, playing chess, shopping stylish clothes, buying consultations with experts like a stylist or a nutritionist, drinking coffee, spending time calmfully and piecefully. Spending time with my parents (at least online, since we live in different countries, but preferably in real life of course). Connecting with nature, being free of all distractions.

How do I want to improve my life right now and what habits I want to build, in order of priority:
- huge amounts of deep work every day, preferably 10 hours
- always having a clear vision of where I’m going, writing goals down, being obsessed over it, doing affirmations, doing visualization, adjusting the vision when regularly because my perception changes
- going to bed (actually lights off) at 8:30 pm and waking up at 5 am
- being more organized: calenader, to-do list
- eliminate distractions: almost no time on social media, no checking updates, no emails, no notifications etc. when using social media for work having all the recommendations blocked so I can focus on the main thing
- I want to have a morning routine (but I love to start working almost immediately) and night routine - and I love routines to be quick and simple
- I want to spend some dedicated daily time on learning, I want to guarantee that I’m becoming 1% better/smarter every day no matter what
- meditation every day to maintain very clear mind
- eating very clean:  beef, chicken, salmon, eggs, avocado, nuts, honey, dark chocolate, rice, quinoa, potato, rarely cheese, dates, banana. almost fully avoid: processedsugars, gluten, low amounts of caffeine, no food after 6 pm, 13h+ fast every day
- having regular workouts, very clean focused time, no distractions in it, focused on the proper technique and workouts tracking, developing my physique gradually, generally active lifestyle, not only sitting at my desk and going to the gym (also I have a height adjustable desk), also building a great posture

All that habits I want to be flexible, I want them to work under different circumstances, I don't wanna be rigid and strict with them.
