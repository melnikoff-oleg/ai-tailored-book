# 📚 AI-Tailored Book: Personalized Reading Made Simple
Welcome to ai-tailored-book, a project where AI takes a real book and rewrites it in a personalized manner, tailoring its advice and insights to your specific context. 📖✨

In this repository, you'll find the tools and workflows used to transform Atomic Habits into actionable, customized content that speaks directly to you.
# 🎯 Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to:
- 🧠 Understand you better by gathering your unique context.
- 📑 Process a book (e.g., Atomic Habits) using OCR, clean the text, and break it into chapters.
- ✍️ Rewrite or summarize each chapter to suit your needs and goals, producing personalized, actionable insights.
# 📂 Repository Structure
Here’s an overview of the repository contents:
- playground.ipynb          # Main Python notebook with the project logic
- my context.txt            # Your context for personalization
- Atomic habits.pdf         # Original book in PDF format
- text OCR and cleaning/    # OCR output and cleaned text files
- rewritten book/           # Fully rewritten personalized book

- requirements.txt          # Required Python packages
# 🚀 How It Works
This project follows these main stages:

**📖 Read the Book**
- Convert the PDF book into text using Optical Character Recognition (OCR).
- Extract and clean the text to eliminate errors, then convert it to Markdown.

**✍️ Write the Context**
- Add personal context about yourself (e.g., goals, preferences, challenges) in my context.txt.
- This ensures the rewritten book feels like it was written specifically for you.

**📚 Process Chapters**
- Split the cleaned text into chapters.
- Choose between:
    - Fully rewriting the book to align with your context.
    - Generating personalized chapter-by-chapter summaries + actionable insights.

**🎯 Personalized Output**
- The final product includes customized summaries with actionable advice you can directly implement.

# ✨ Example Output
**📖 Chapter: The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits**

**SUMMARY**

This chapter of Atomic Habits emphasizes the transformative power of minuscule changes and their compounding effects over time. Inspired by the British Cycling team's remarkable success through marginal gains, it teaches that a series of tiny, seemingly insignificant actions can lead to massive results. The focus shifts from lofty goals to consistent, incremental improvements – typical 1% betterment each day – that in their totality, become a catalyst for significant personal and professional growth.

Your ambition to enhance productivity, organizational skills, and overall health aligns with the concept of leveraging small habitual changes for larger life impacts.

**ACTIONABLES**
- **Minute Morning Review 🌄**: Spend the first 5 minutes after waking up to quickly review your main tasks for the day. This aligns your mind with your daily goals without consuming much time.
- **Daily Goals Journaling 📔**: Each morning, post-review, write down the key goals you need to achieve by the end of the day. This crystallizes your focus and builds a vision-oriented habit.
