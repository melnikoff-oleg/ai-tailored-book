### The 1st Law

## Make It Obvious

- **4. The Man Who Didn't Look Right**
  
  Just as the man who didn't look right needed adjustments to his appearance to properly fit in, you may find that reevaluating your remote work environment could provide substantial benefits. By simply having visual reminders like motivational quotes from leading tech visionaries, or clear notes outlining your daily main tasks visible in your work cabinet, you can create a more conducive atmosphere for focus and creativity in your AI projects.

- **5. The Best Way to Start a New Habit**
  
  For someone striving to integrate deep work phases into a daily routine as you do, start by making these phases obvious. Schedule these blocks of critical thinking time during your early morning hours—a time you have identified as when you're most productive. Place a sign on your office door or a status update in your household communication system during these times to remind Anastasiia and enforce the boundaries necessary for you to maintain this key habit.

- **6. Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More**
  
  Consider how your current setup in your home office aids in habit formation. Is your office organized in a way that maximizes your effectiveness? As a tech enthusiast and an AI expert, design your space to minimize distractions—a place for everything and everything in its place. This might mean having dual monitors for coding and content creation, ergonomic furniture for prolonged working hours, or high-quality headphones to block out background noise.

- **7. The Secret to Self-Control**
  
  In your case, self-control largely revolves around managing distractions from social media and maintaining a rigorous schedule. One powerful change could be setting technological boundaries—using apps that limit your social media access during work hours, thus reducing the impulse to check notifications. Furthermore, given your need to rise early, automating 'do not disturb' settings on your devices to wind down by 8 pm can support your aim for better sleep hygiene, helping you to get up at 5 am as planned.

### The 2nd Law

## Make It Attractive

- The lure of immediate gratification is strong in environments like social media. To align your habits more closely with your goals, reframe your necessities into appealing activities. If producing daily AI content feels overwhelming, link it to your broader goals of personal brand building and deepening your AI expertise. This linkage transforms the routine task into an attractive investment in your future as an AI thought leader and influencer in the tech community.

### The Laws Applied to Your Life

In applying these laws, you would reshape your day to emphasize your new identity as a disciplined, innovative tech entrepreneur sharply focused on impacting the AI domain. Each adjustment in your environment and each reformulation of your tasks not only makes your daily habits obvious and attractive but also sets the stage for the powerful, incremental growth that these Atomic Habits can generate in your personal and professional life.
### The 3rd Law

## Make It Easy

- 11. Walk Slowly, but Never Backward
    In the world of tech and AI, where rapid progression is key, this principle echoes the importance of taking consistent, albeit small, strides forward. In your quest to build a business around AI, it's crucial to simplify the tasks to make progress tangible. Just like setting up your development environment to start coding right away every morning without distractions, systematizing the start of your day can make deep work in AI more approachable and less daunting.

- 12. The Law of Least Effort
    In your home office in Dubai, set up your workspace to minimize effort in starting work. Have your coding tools, AI journals, and key resources within easy reach. By preparing your environment to align with your goals—such as keeping distracting devices in another room—you make it easier to dive deep into AI development or content creation, leveraging the law of least effort to foster productivity.

- 13. How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule
    Applying the two-minute rule could transform how you handle social media obligations for your brand. If opening your content management tools and scheduling a post takes less than two minutes, do it first thing in the morning before deep work sessions. This habit can prevent the scroll-and-get-lost syndrome that often comes with social media.

- 14. How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible
    You might consider utilizing apps that restrict your access to social media during work hours to ensure that your focus remains undiluded while engaging in AI development. By making distractions harder to access, you're architecting your environment to naturally shepherd you towards productivity and away from time-wasters.

# The 4th Law

**Make It Satisfying**

- 15. The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change
    Make your habitual engagement in AI learning and content creation satisfying by tracking and celebrating small accomplishments. Implement a reward system like enjoying a small wellness activity—maybe a quick walk or a session with your infrared sauna—after completing a set number of coding hours or after successfully solving a problem.

- 16. How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day
    Use your affinity for structured exercise as an analog for structuring your professional tasks. Just as you have a dedicated time and protocol for your workouts, establish and adhere to specific times for deep work and content creation. This can cultivate the discipline needed to make these activities daily habits.

- 17. How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything
    Form a small, exclusive group of fellow AI enthusiasts and content creators where you can share daily progress, challenges, and wins. This kind of accountability can be incredibly motivating. As you all strive to enhance your personal brands, the shared commitment can keep you engaged and less likely to skip the essential tasks, even on less motivated days.

## Advanced Tactics

**How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great**

- 18. The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don't)
    While your background in mathematics and computer science provides a strong foundation, the differentiation in greatness may come from how you habitually refine those talents into skills that are rare and valuable. Embrace continuous learning and practical application in AI to ensure your talents are not just maintained but amplified.

- 19. The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work
    To keep your motivation for AI and content production high, set challenges that are neither too easy nor too hard—akin to finding the right resistance in a workout that pushes you enough to grow but not so much that it leads to burnout. Adjust your learning and creation tasks to align with this principle to maintain engagement.

- 20. The Downside of Creating Good Habits
    Be cautious of any rigidity that may develop from your structured habits. It’s essential to remain flexible and open to adapting your habits as your business landscape and personal life evolve. Balancing structured habits with adaptive flexibility can prevent you from becoming too rigid or stressed by the inevitable changes in a dynamic field like AI.

## Introduction

### My Story

During an ordinary day, similar to when you relocated from Amsterdam to Dubai, unexpected challenges could completely disrupt your routine. Just as I did when recovering from an accident, it's crucial during such times to harness the habits formed in more structured environments to recalibrate and regain momentum in your new setting.
```markdown
ose. Shocked and confused, I was unaware of how seriously I had been injured.

My teacher looped his arm around my shoulder and we began the long walk to the nurse’s office: across the field, down the hill, and back into school. Random hands touched my sides, holding me upright. We took our time and walked slowly. Nobody realized that every minute mattered.

When we arrived at the nurse’s office, she asked me a series of questions.

- “What year is it?”
- “1998,” I answered. It was actually 2002.
- “Who is the president of the United States?”
- “Bill Clinton,” I said. The correct answer was George W. Bush.
- “What is your mom’s name?”
- “Uh. Um.” I stalled. Ten seconds passed.
- “Patti,” I said casually, ignoring the fact that it had taken me ten seconds to remember my own mother’s name.

That is the last question I remember. My body was unable to handle the rapid swelling in my brain and I lost consciousness before the ambulance arrived.

Minutes later, I was carried out of school and taken to the local hospital. Shortly after arriving, my body began shutting down. I struggled with basic functions like swallowing and breathing. I had my first seizure of the day. Then I

Stopped breathing entirely. As the doctors hurried to supply me with oxygen, they also decided the local hospital was unequipped to handle the situation and ordered a helicopter to fly me to a larger hospital in Cincinnati.

I was rolled out of the emergency room doors and toward the helipad across the street. The stretcher rattled on a bumpy sidewalk as one nurse pushed me along while another pumped each breath into me by hand. My mother, who had arrived at the hospital a few moments before, climbed into the helicopter beside me. I remained unconscious and unable to breathe on my own as she held my hand during the flight.

While my mother rode with me in the helicopter, my father went home to check on my brother and sister and break the news to them. He choked back tears as he explained to my sisters
```

```markdown
r that he would miss her eighth-grade graduation ceremony that night. After passing my siblings off to family and friends, he drove to Cincinnati to meet my mother.

When my mom and I landed on the roof of the hospital, a team of nearly twenty doctors and nurses sprinted onto the helipad and wheeled me into the trauma unit. By this time, the swelling in my brain had become so severe that I was having repeated post-traumatic seizures. My broken bones needed to be fixed, but I was in no condition to undergo surgery. After yet another seizure—my third of the day—I was put into a medically induced coma and placed on a ventilator.

My parents were no strangers to this hospital. Ten years earlier, they had entered the same building on the ground floor after my sister was diagnosed with leukemia at age three. I was five at the time. My brother was just six months old. After two and a half years of chemotherapy treatments, spinal taps, and bone marrow biopsies, my little sister finally walked out of the hospital happy, healthy, and cancer-free. And now, after ten years of normal life, my parents found themselves back in the same place with a different child.

While I slipped into a coma, the hospital sent a priest and a social worker to comfort my parents. It was the same priest who had met with them a decade earlier on the evening they found out my sister had cancer.

As day faded into night, a series of machines kept me alive. My parents slept restlessly on a hospital mattress—one moment they would collapse from fatigue, the next they would be wide awake with worry. My mother would tell me later, “It was one of the worst nights I’ve ever had.”

## My Recovery

- Mercifully, by the next morning my breathing had rebounded to the point where the doctors felt comfortable releasing me from the coma. When I finally regained consciousness, I discovered that I had lost my ability to smell. As a test, a nurse asked me to blow my nose and sniff an apple juice box. My sense of smell
```

returned, but—to everyone’s surprise—the act of blowing my nose forced air through the fractures in my eye socket and pushed my left eye outward. My eyeball bulged out of the socket, held precariously in place by my eyelid and the optic nerve attaching my eye to my brain.

- The ophthalmologist said my eye would gradually slide back into place as the air seeped out, but it was hard to tell how long this would take. I was scheduled for surgery one week later, which would allow me some additional time to heal. I looked like I had been on the wrong end of a boxing match, but I was cleared to leave the hospital. I returned home with a broken nose, half a dozen facial fractures, and a bulging left eye.
- The following months were hard. It felt like everything in my life was on pause. I had double vision for weeks; I literally couldn’t see straight. It took more than a month, but my eyeball did eventually return to its normal location. Between the seizures and my vision problems, it was eight months before I could drive a car again. At physical therapy, I practiced basic motor patterns like walking in a straight line. I was determined not to let my injury get me down, but there were more than a few moments when I felt depressed and overwhelmed.
- I became painfully aware of how far I had to go when I returned to the baseball field one year later. Baseball had always been a major part of my life. My dad had played minor league baseball for the St. Louis Cardinals, and I had a dream of playing professionally, too. After months of rehabilitation, what I wanted more than anything was to get back on the field.
- But my return to baseball was not smooth. When the season rolled around, I was the only junior to be cut from the varsity baseball team. I was sent down to play with the sophomores on junior varsity. I had been playing since age four, and for someone who had spent so much time and effort on the sport, getting cut was humiliating. I vividly remember the day it happened.

This part of the story resonates deeply with my own experiences of setbacks, not in sports but in my current endeavors like developing AI solutions and building my personal brand. Just like returning to the baseball field, each time I face a technical challenge or a bottleneck in a project, it feels like standing at the plate ready to swing. And much like being cut from the team, missing a project deadline or receiving negative feedback can feel like a major blow to my aspirations. Yet, the key takeaway is the resilience and the system of continual improvement—every coding session, every algorithm optimized, and every new piece of content I create for my YouTube channel is a step towards becoming the tech entrepreneur I aspire to be. Moreover, structuring my day to start with the most impactful tasks, just like those physical therapy sessions, helps prevent the smaller, routine tasks from sidelining my larger goals. This not only keeps my professional development on track but also strengthens my personal systems, reinforcing my identity as a dedicated AI expert and an emerging leader in the tech space.
# How I Learned About Habits

Attending Denison was one of the best decisions of my life. I earned a spot on the baseball team and, although I was at the bottom of the roster as a freshman, I was thrilled. Despite the chaos of my high school years, I had managed to become a college athlete.

I wasn’t going to be starting on the baseball team anytime soon, so I focused on getting my life in order. While my peers stayed up late and played video games, I built good sleep habits and went to bed early each night. In the messy world of a college dorm, I made a point to keep my room neat and tidy. These improvements were minor, but they gave me a sense of control over my life. I started to feel confident again. And this growing belief in myself rippled into the classroom as I improved my study habits and managed to earn straight A’s during my first year.

Similarly, as a 24-year-old tech entrepreneur now based in Dubai, you can reflect on how small, consistent habits can have a transformative impact. Just as I focused on sleep habits and organization, you aim to wake up at 5 a.m. daily to dedicate your prime hours to AI and content creation. Building a strict morning routine, similar to my early bedtimes, could streamline your day and enhance focus, enabling more effective deep work sessions in your cabinet, free from distractions and interruptions.

A habit is a routine or behavior that is performed regularly—and, in many cases, automatically. As each semester passed, I accumulated small but consistent habits that ultimately led to results that were unimaginable to me when I started. For example, for the first time in my life, I made it a habit to lift weights multiple times per week, and in the years that followed, my six-foot-four-inch frame gained 20 pounds of muscle. You've incorporated daily workouts into your regimen, which is commendable. To avoid fluctuations and build consistency, consider setting a fixed workout time each day, much like you plan to solidify your waking hours. This habit will not only improve your physical health but will also provide mental clarity and resilience, essential for your entrepreneurial ambitions and personal development.

By adopting these atomic habits, you're not just aiming to enhance productivity or fitness but also to embody the identity of a disciplined, innovative, and successful AI leader—qualities that resonate deeply with your desired self-image.
When my sophomore season arrived, I earned a starting role on the pitching staff. By my junior year, I was voted team captain and at the end of the season, I was selected for the all-conference team. But it was not until my senior season that my sleep habits, study habits, and strength-training habits really began to pay off.

Six years after I had been hit in the face with a baseball bat, flown to the hospital, and placed into a coma, I was selected as the top male athlete at Denison University and named to the ESPN Academic All-America Team—an honor given to just thirty-three players across the country. By the time I graduated, I was listed in the school record books in eight different categories. That same year, I was awarded the university’s highest academic honor, the President’s Medal.

I hope you’ll forgive me if this sounds boastful. To be honest, there was nothing legendary or historic about my athletic career. I never ended up playing professional sports or setting any records. But what I did learn at Denison was the incredible power of small habits. And that lesson has stayed with me ever since.

Professionally. However, looking back on those years, I believe I accomplished something just as rare: I fulfilled my potential. And I believe the concepts in this book can help you fulfill your potential as well.

We all face challenges in life. This injury was one of mine, and the experience taught me a critical lesson: changes that seem small and unimportant at first will compound into remarkable results if you’re willing to stick with them for years. We can draw a parallel to your journey in transitioning to your new entrepreneurial venture in Dubai, balancing complex AI projects with content creation, and maintaining a disciplined lifestyle. These don't appear monumental when considered as isolated acts, but over time, they compound and can significantly impact your professional outcomes and personal satisfaction.

We all deal with setbacks but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you’ll end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible. Just as you've established a routine of waking at 5 AM and focusing your early hours on AI development—despite the pull of social media and easy distractions—every moment you reinforce this habit, you're voting for the identity of being a committed, pioneering tech entrepreneur. And in the complex and fast-changing world of AI and technology, such structured habits might very well be the backbone of your success.

Maybe there are people who can achieve incredible success overnight. I don’t know any of them, and I’m certainly not one of them. In your context, building AI systems and crafting engaging, educational content for burgeoning tech enthusiasts are tasks that require persistence and evolve with continuous learning and adapting—mirroring the small, yet powerful, habits I developed during my recovery and college sports career.
### HOW AND WHY I WROTE THIS BOOK

In November 2012, I began publishing articles at jamesclear.com. For years, I had been keeping notes about my personal experiments with habits and I was finally ready to share some of them publicly. I began by publishing a new article every Monday and Thursday. Within a few months, this simple writing habit led to my first one thousand email subscribers, and by the end of 2013 that number had grown to more than thirty thousand people.

In 2014, my email list expanded to over one hundred thousand subscribers, which made it one of the fastest-growing newsletters on the internet. I had felt like an impostor when I began writing two years earlier, but now I was becoming known as an expert on habits—a new label that excited me but also felt uncomfortable. I had never considered myself a master of the topic, but rather someone who was experimenting alongside my readers.

In 2015, I reached two hundred thousand email subscribers and signed a book deal with Penguin Random House to begin writing the book you are reading now. As my audience grew, so did my business opportunities. I was increasingly asked to speak at top companies about the science of habit formation, behavior change, and continuous improvement. I found myself delivering keynote speeches at conferences in the United States and Europe.

In 2016, my articles began to appear regularly in major publications like Time, Entrepreneur, and Forbes. Incredibly, my writing was read by over eight million people that year. Coaches in the NFL, NBA, and MLB began reading my work and sharing it with their teams.

Just like your journey into the world of AI and entrepreneurship, my path was built on the accumulation of small, consistent actions. Each article written, much like every line of code you write or every video you produce for your YouTube channel, was a step towards where I am now. The habits I developed in my writing paralleled the disciplined approach you've taken towards mastering AI technologies and building your personal brand. This iterative process of improvement and the feedback from a growing audience refined my skills and honed my message, very much like your iterative development of AI models and engagement with your online community helps improve your offerings.

Consistency in the small, seemingly minor actions has allowed both of us to build towards larger aspirations. As you structure your days to prioritize deep work on AI and minimize distractions, consider how developing a regular scheduling habit, much like my bi-weekly article postings, could streamline your processes and enhance your productivity. By minimizing the chaos of sporadic work and establishing clear boundaries with those around you, including your living and working arrangements with Anastasiia, you set a foundation much like the one that supported my own growth.

Thus, every habit you develop, every routine you solidify, and every small step you take is not just about the immediate results but about building that greater future—the one where you are a renowned tech entrepreneur and a thought leader in AI. Just as my repeated habits of writing clarified and reinforced my identity as an expert in habits, your consistent actions in AI and content creation will solidify your identity in the tech world.
# How This Book Will Benefit You

The entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant has said, “To write a great book, you must first become the book.” I originally learned about the ideas mentioned here because I had to live them. I had to rely on small habits to rebound from my injury, to get stronger in the gym, to perform at a high level on the field, to become a writer, to build a successful business, and simply to develop into a responsible adult. Small habits helped me fulfill my potential, and since you picked up this book, I’m guessing you’d like to fulfill yours as well.

In the pages that follow, I will share a step-by-step plan for building better habits—not for days or weeks, but for a lifetime. While science supports everything I’ve written, this book is not an academic research paper; it’s an operating manual. You’ll find wisdom and practical advice front and center as I explain the science of how to create and change your habits in a way that is easy to understand and apply, meshing perfectly with your life as an aspiring tech entrepreneur working from your home office in Dubai.

Imagine this: every morning, as you aim to wake up at 5 am, the first thing you do is engage with a pre-arranged cue, such as preparing a quiet workspace the night before, which leads to the habit of starting your day focusing on AI development—without distractions. This could leverage what I call "environment design," crucial for your productivity. Each intentional environment adjustment, like having your AI books and tools ready on your desk, nudges you towards more efficient work habits, which could be critical in turning your technical skills into groundbreaking AI solutions.

The fields I draw on—biology, neuroscience, philosophy, psychology, and more—have been around for many years. What I offer you is a synthesis of the best ideas smart people figured out in these areas, honed by my experiences and tailored to fit someone like you—a tech enthusiast looking to found a startup while managing a vibrant personal life. This synthesis will help you understand how seemingly small changes, such as setting specific work-life boundaries with your girlfriend Anastasiia, can streamline your focus and elevate your productivity, propelling you toward your goal of becoming a legendary tech maestro.
The backbone of this book is my four-step model of habits—cue, craving, response, and reward—and the four laws of behavior change that evolve out of these steps. Readers with a psychology background may recognize some of these terms from operant conditioning, which was first proposed as “stimulus, response, reward” by B. F. Skinner in the 1930s and has been popularized more recently as “cue, routine, reward” in *The Power of Habit* by Charles Duhigg. Behavioral scientists like Skinner realized that if you offered the right reward or punishment, you could get people to act in a certain way. But while Skinner’s model did an excellent job of explaining how external stimuli influenced our habits, it lacked a good explanation for how our thoughts, feelings, and beliefs impact our behavior. Internal states—our moods and emotions—matter, too. Just like how your mood might affect your decision to work on an AI project or take a break scrolling through Twitter. Recent research, integrated here, connects our emotional states with our habits more explicitly, shedding light on behaviors like your late-night social media sessions or early-morning coding.

In total, the framework I offer is an integrated model of the cognitive and behavioral sciences. I believe it is one of the first models of human behavior to accurately account for both the influence of external stimuli and internal emotions on our habits. While some of the language may be familiar, the details—and the applications of the Four Laws of Behavior Change—will offer a new way to think about your habits.

Human behavior is always changing: situation to situation, moment to moment, second to second. But this book is about what doesn’t change. It’s about the fundamentals of human behavior. The lasting principles you can apply to channel your passion for artificial intelligence and technology into robust, sustainable systems that propel you towards becoming a legendary tech entrepreneur. Consider how the clarity of your vision board directly aligns with the cues of habit formation, reinforcing your daily resolve to advance in AI and refine your technical skills. With each habit loop, your identity as a disciplined, innovative entrepreneur becomes further ingrained, making it not just what you do, but fundamentally who you are.

Why Tiny Changes Make a Big Difference

### The Surprising Power of Atomic Habits

Consider the transformation you're seeking in your own entrepreneurial journey, akin to the profound turnaround of the British Cycling team which began in 2003 under Dave Brailsford. 

- Prior to 2003, British cycling performances were rather underwhelming.
- Historically, British riders since 1908 had secured only one gold medal at the Olympic Games.
- They had never triumphed in the Tour de France.
- Even manufacturers hesitated to sell their best bikes to the team, fearing it could tarnish their brand.

Then came Brailsford, who introduced the philosophy of seeking 1% improvements in every imaginable aspect of a cyclist’s performance and welfare, echoing your ambition to refine your AI skills and content creation routines daily.

- Just as minor adjustments like redesigned bike seats and improved tire grip enhanced cycling performance, imagine tweaking your daily schedule to allocate specific, undisturbed time blocks for deep work on AI projects and content creation, enhancing focus and output quality.
- Think of optimizing your home environment, much like how cyclists' muscle temperatures were maintained with electrically heated overshorts. Perhaps setting your workspace temperature, lighting, and reducing noise could help in maintaining your focus and energy levels.
- In your case, a thorough analysis of work tools—selecting optimal software and hardware for programming or video editing—can significantly streamline your content creation and AI development processes, much like how the riders benefited from biofeedback sensors and aerodynamic racing suits.
- Adopting a disciplined sleep schedule and diet, mirroring how cyclists' recovery strategies involved specialized massage gels and tailored pillow types, can greatly influence your daily cognitive and physical performance. Ensuring you have a nourishing breakfast like oatmeal or eggs can set a positive tone for the day.

By applying these small 1% improvements consistently, not unlike Brailsford’s holistic approach to every detail of cycling, you can expect to see a compounding effect that elevates your productivity, sharpens your AI expertise, and enhances your content quality over time. These marginal gains may seem trivial day to day, just as in the case of manipulating racing suit fabrics, but their cumulative impact over months and years can be the difference between a commonplace and an extraordinary entrepreneurial career in the tech and AI domain.
Just five years after Brailsford took over, the British Cycling team dominated the road and track cycling events at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, where they won an astounding 60 percent of the gold medals available. Four years later, when the Olympic Games came to London, the Brits raised the bar as they set nine Olympic records and seven world records.

That same year, Bradley Wiggins became the first British cyclist to win the Tour de France. The next year, his teammate Chris Froome won the race, and he would go on to win again in 2015, 2016, and 2017, giving the British team five Tour de France victories in six years.

During the ten-year span from 2007 to 2017, British cyclists won 178 world championships and sixty-six Olympic or Paralympic gold medals and captured five Tour de France victories in what is widely regarded as the most successful run in cycling history.

How does this happen? How does a team of previously ordinary athletes transform into world champions with tiny changes that, at first glance, would seem to make a modest difference at best? Why do small improvements accumulate into such remarkable results, and how can you replicate this approach in your own life?

It is so easy to overestimate the importance of one defining moment and underestimate the value of making small improvements on a daily basis. Too often, we convince ourselves that massive success requires massive action. Whether it is losing weight, building a business, writing a book, winning a championship, or optimizing your workflow and deep work sessions in your personal home office in Dubai, the same principle applies.

- Meanwhile, improving by 1 percent isn’t particularly notable—sometimes it isn’t even noticeable—but it can be far more impactful. For instance, adjusting your morning routine to include a review of your visualization/affirmation board can subtly reinforce your goals and mindset daily. Over time, this small habit can radically steer your focus and actions towards the life you envision.

**HM**

The difference a tiny improvement can make over time is astounding.

Here’s how the math works out for you as an aspiring tech entrepreneur: if you improve your AI skills, content creation, or personal branding tactics by just 1% each day:

- Conversely, if you allow distractions or procrastination to get 1 percent worse each day, your productivity and focus could decline nearly down to zero. What starts as a small win or a minor setback accumulates into something much more significant.

### 1% BETTER EVERY DAY

- 1% worse every day for one year: 0.99365 = 00.03
- 1% better every day for one year: 1.01365 = 37.78

# Results

- 1% IMPROVEMENT
- 1% DECLINE

# Time

**FIGURE 1:** The effects of small habits compound over time. For example, if you can get just 1 percent better each day at managing your time or enhancing your expertise in machine learning, you'll end up with results that are nearly 37 times better after one year.

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement in your life. The same way that money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. They may seem to make little difference on any given day, yet the impact they deliver over the months and years can be enormous. It is only when looking back two, five, or perhaps ten years later that the value of good habits—like consistently refining your business model or mastering new AI technologies—and the cost of bad ones—such as neglecting daily planning or succumbing to unnecessary distractions—becomes strikingly apparent.

This can be a difficult concept to appreciate in daily life. We often dismiss small changes because they don’t seem to matter very much in the moment. If

- If you spend a little more time each morning reviewing your visualisation board, you're still not instantly clear about your long-term goals. If you consistently start your workdays without checking social media, you might still feel the itch to browse. We make a few changes, but the results never seem to come quickly, and so we might slide back into our previous routines.

- Unfortunately, the slow pace of transformation also makes it easy to let a bad habit slide. If you skip your morning routine to dive straight into emails, the immediate consequence isn't drastic. If you decide to stay up late watching movies with Anastasiia, missing your 8 PM bedtime, it feels okay the first few times. If you keep your phone on while working and respond to notifications, it might seem like you’re still being productive. A single decision is easy to dismiss.

- But when these 1% seemingly insignificant bad decisions accumulate, you find yourself in a self-reinforcing downward spiral: stress leading to more unstructured days without focus, ending in less productivity and satisfaction. Each day offers opportunities for tiny improvements that can lead to significant growth or gradual decline. Building good habits like powering through a set of well-defined work blocks, or turning your phone off to delve into deep work, might seem nominal, yet they could be the key to achieving the profound success and adopting the identity of a legendary tech maestro that you aspire to be.
- When we repeat 1 percent errors, day after day, by replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalizing little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results. It's the accumulation of many missteps—a 1 percent decline here and there—that eventually leads to a problem. For instance, repeatedly neglecting to review your visualization/affirmation board or consistently consuming unhealthy snacks, like your occasional indulgences in coke or dark chocolate, might seem minor but can derail your efforts towards developing a disciplined, healthy lifestyle.

- The impact created by a change in your habits is similar to the effect of shifting the route of an airplane by just a few degrees. Imagine you are flying from Los Angeles to New York City. If a pilot leaving from LAX adjusts the heading just 3.5 degrees south, you will land in Washington, D.C., instead of New York. Such a small change is barely noticeable at takeoff—the nose of the airplane moves just a few feet—but when magnified across the entire United States, you end up hundreds of miles apart. Similarly, a slight change in your daily habits, like ensuring you go to bed at 8:30 pm to wake up at 5 am, or dedicating specific blocks of time for distraction-free deep work, can significantly influence your trajectory toward becoming a successful tech entrepreneur and content creator.

- That said, it doesn't matter how successful or unsuccessful you are right now. What matters is whether your habits are putting you on the path toward success. You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results. If you're a millionaire but you spend more than you earn each month, then you're on a bad trajectory. If your spending habits don't change, it's not going to end well. Conversely, if you're relatively new in Dubai and setting up your lifestyle, but you systematically work towards building a robust routine that supports your professional and personal goals—like systematically engaging with your AI projects and creating content around them each day—then you're on the path toward lasting achievement and personal fulfillment, even if progress seems slow.

- Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. Your net worth is a lagging measure of your financial habits. Your weight is a lagging measure of your eating habits. Your knowledge is a lagging measure of your learning habits. Your clutter is a lagging measure of your cleaning habits. You get what you consistently work for. For instance, the mastery of AI and the growth of your personal brand are lagging measures of your learning and content creation habits. By consistently engaging in these practices daily, you're likely to achieve the legendary status you aspire to in the tech world.

- If you want to predict where you'll end up in life, all you have to do is follow the curve of tiny gains or tiny losses, and see how your daily choices will compound ten or twenty years down the line. Each tiny decision you make—from attending a networking event for AI enthusiasts to leveraging small pockets of time to clear your backlog of routine tasks—will multiply over time and fundamentally shape the trajectory of your life and career.
**YOUR HABITS CAN COMPOUND FOR YOU OR AGAINST YOU**

**Positive Compounding**

**WHAT PROGRESS IS REALLY LIKE**

Imagine that you have an ice cube sitting on the table in front of you. The room is cold and you can see your breath. It is currently twenty-five degrees. Ever so slowly, the room begins to heat up.

Twenty-six degrees.

Twenty-seven.

Twenty-eight.

The ice cube is still sitting on the table in front of you.

Twenty-nine degrees.

- Thirty.
- Thirty-one.
- Still, nothing has happened.
- Then, thirty-two degrees. The ice begins to melt. A one-degree shift, seemingly no different from the temperature increases before it, has unlocked a huge change.
  
Consider your own experiences after relocating to Dubai, trying to establish a productive routine in a new city. Initially, the progress seems slow, just as the temperature slowly rises without any visible change to the ice cube. However, each day you wake up at 5 am, each day you dedicate to AI research or maintain discipline in managing distractions, you're adding a degree of change.

- Breakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change. This pattern shows up everywhere. Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable, then takes over the body in months. Bamboo can barely be seen for the first five years as it builds extensive root systems underground before exploding ninety feet into the air within six weeks.

Similarly, your efforts in creating high-quality content, improving AI skills or establishing a strong personal brand may seem to bear little fruit initially. Think of your early days learning algorithms or machine learning—skills built slowly over time eventually leading to your current expertise.

- Likewise, habits often appear to make no difference until you cross a critical threshold and unlock a new level of performance. In the early and middle stages of any quest, there is often a Valley of Disappointment.
  
Reflect on your journey to integrate workouts consistently at a specific time each day. Initially, the fluctuations in your schedule led to frustration, mirroring the Valley of Disappointment. However, steadiness in your efforts ultimately invites noticeable improvements in agility, strength, and overall physical health.

- This is one of the core reasons why it is so hard to build habits that last. People make a few small changes, fail to see a tangible result, and decide to stop. You think, “I’ve been running every day for a month, so why can’t I see any change in my body?

In your context, your consistent early risings and efforts to cut off distractions could initially feel ineffective. You stabilize your schedules, yet sometimes a spike in social media use or a disruption in your bedtime routine occurs. It’s crucial here not to abandon your systematic approach but to recognize that these small, optimized adjustments (your 26...27...28 degrees) set the stage for the 32-degree shift—for the morning when you wake fully rested and ready to excel in your venture without coaxing.
” Once this kind of thinking takes over, it’s easy to let good habits fall by the wayside. But in order to make a meaningful difference, habits need to persist long enough to break through this plateau—what I call the Plateau of Latent Potential.
- If you find yourself struggling to build a good habit or break a bad one, it is not because you have lost your ability to improve. It is often because you have not yet crossed the Plateau of Latent Potential. Complaining about not achieving success despite working hard is like complaining about an ice cube not melting when you heated it from twenty-five to thirty-one degrees. Your work was not wasted; it is just being stored. All the action happens at thirty-two degrees.
- The outside world only sees the most dramatic event rather than all that preceded it. But you know that it’s the work you did long ago—when it seemed that you weren't making any progress—that makes the jump today possible. For example, the gradual improvements you're making in your AI projects or content creation may not seem significant day to day but are accumulating to prepare you for a major breakthrough.
- It is the human equivalent of geological pressure. Two tectonic plates can grind against one another for millions of years, the tension slowly building all the while. Then, one day, they rub each other once again, in the same fashion they have for ages, but this time the tension is too great. An earthquake erupts. Change can take years—before it happens all at once. Mastery requires patience. Think of this as akin to your switch from algorithmic trading to focusing on AI solutions in your entrepreneurial venture; what seems a slow transition will one day culminate in significant success. The San Antonio Spurs, one of the most successful teams in NBA history, have a quote from social reformer Jacob Riis hanging in their locker room: “When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that last blow that did it—but all that had gone before.” Like in your efforts in waking early at 5 AM consistently, each attempt contributes to building the discipline that fuels your productivity and visionary work.
**FORGET ABOUT GOALS, FOCUS ON SYSTEMS INSTEAD**

Prevailing wisdom claims that the best way to achieve what we want in life—getting into better shape, building a successful business, relaxing more and worrying less, spending more time with friends and family—is to set specific, actionable goals.

For many years, this was how I approached my habits, too. Each one was a goal to be reached. I set goals for the grades I wanted to get in school, for the weights I wanted to lift in the gym, for the profits I wanted to earn in business. I succeeded at a few, but I failed at a lot of them. Eventually, I began to realize that my results had very little to do with the goals I set and nearly everything to do with the systems I followed.

What’s the difference between systems and goals? It’s a distinction I first learned from Scott Adams, the cartoonist behind *Dilbert*. Like many of us, you might be focused highly on specific outcomes: waking up at 5 am, drastically minimizing distractions, becoming a maestro in the AI field, or making $1,000,000 in profit each month from your business. These are admirable goals, but they are endpoints, not means to an end.

Let's think about your daily system – the routine that includes deep-focus work periods for AI project development free from distractions, consistent workout times to maintain physical health, and scheduled moments for reading or walking that ensure mental wellbeing. Instead of being frustrated by not hitting target metrics (like waking up strictly at 5 am every day), why not refine these systems?

By developing a system that emphasizes continuous learning, open communication with your girlfriend Anastasiia about respecting work boundaries, and better management of minor routine tasks, you'll progress more effectively towards your broader entrepreneurial and personal goals. Systems are about the arranged processes that edge you closer to your desires daily.

For instance, consider your struggle with maintaining a consistently early wake-up routine. Shift your focus from the goal of "waking up at 5 am" to the system that instigates why you might fail at this — perhaps it's the lack of a winding-down ritual the night before or not syncing sleep schedules with Anastasiia. Can you systemize a relaxing pre-bed routine that starts at 8 pm to help both of you wind down?

Similarly, in managing distractions, aim not just to reduce social media use but develop a productivity system. This could involve turning off notifications, planning designated times for social media for content posting, and using apps that limit your access to distractions during work hours.

Remember, when you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don't have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envisage.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

> You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Incorporate system thinking into your tech entrepreneurship and personal habits. This switch from goal-focused outcomes to refining your daily systems might just be the pioneer change that propels you from being good to great, both in life and work.
- If you’re a coach, your goal might be to win a championship. Your system is the way you recruit players, manage your assistant coaches, and conduct practice.
- If you’re an entrepreneur, your goal might be to build a million-dollar business. Your system is how you test product ideas, hire employees, and run marketing campaigns.
- If you’re a musician, your goal might be to play a new piece. Your system is how often you practice, how you break down and tackle difficult measures, and your method for receiving feedback from your instructor.

Now for the interesting question: If you completely ignored your goals and focused only on your system, would you still succeed? For example, if you were a basketball coach and you ignored your goal to win a championship and focused only on what your team does at practice each day, would you still get results?

I think you would.

The goal in any sport is to finish with the best score, but it would be ridiculous to spend the whole game staring at the scoreboard. The only way to actually win is to get better each day. In the words of three-time Super Bowl winner Bill Walsh, “The score takes care of itself.” The same is true for other areas of life. If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. Focus on your system instead.

What do I mean by this? Are goals completely useless? Of course not. Goals are good for setting a direction, but systems are best for making progress. A handful of problems arise when you spend too much time thinking about your goals and not enough time designing your systems.

Goal setting suffers from a serious case of survivorship bias. We concentrate on the people who end up winning—the survivors—and mistakenly assume that ambitious goals led to their success while overlooking all of the people who had the same objective but didn’t succeed.

Every Olympian aims to win a gold medal, but only a few do. Like them, as a tech entrepreneur, your goal might be to create a successful AI-driven solution that revolutionizes an industry or to establish a dominant personal brand represented worldwide through platforms like Twitter and YouTube. Viewing success not as a big bang moment but as a sustained building process helps.

In your everyday routine as a tech entrepreneur and content creator, focusing solely on the end goal—like hitting a million followers or a million-dollar revenue mark—might lead you to overlook the importance of the daily systems that incrementally drive you towards that success. Your system involves disciplined early mornings focused on prioritized AI project development, efficiently managing your time to ward off distractions, and systematically nurturing your brand through consistent, high-quality content creation across your chosen platforms.

By concentrating on refining these systems—you create a conducive work environment in your separate cabinet, schedule daily uninterrupted deep work sessions, protect these with clear boundaries even in your personal life, and design rituals that promote recovery and readiness like morning affirmations, personal wellness sessions, and structured downtime—you set a foundation that promotes sustained productivity and innovation.

This way, your daily adherence to a system not just optimizes your immediate work output but gradually builds the layers of your envisioned success, ensuring that even on days where direct results might seem scant, the structure is there to support continued growth and encourage persistence.

In essence, treat your entrepreneurial journey and personal brand building like an athlete treats training: the goal is a guiding star, but daily practice—the system—is what truly hones prowess and ensures readiness for those pivotal moments that call for peak performance.
    wants to win a gold medal. Every candidate wants to get the job. And if successful and unsuccessful people share the same goals, then the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers. It wasn’t the goal of winning the Tour de France that propelled the British cyclists to the top of the sport. Presumably, they had wanted to win the race every year before—just like every other professional team. The goal had always been there. It was only when they implemented a system of continuous small improvements that they achieved a different outcome.

- If you summon the energy to tidy up, then you will have a clean room—for now. But if you maintain the same sloppy, tech-junk cluttered office that led to a messy workspace in the first place, soon you’ll be looking at a new pile of gadgets and papers and hoping for another burst of motivation. You’re left chasing the same outcome because you never changed the system behind it. You treated a symptom without addressing the cause.

Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results. When you solve problems at the results level, you only solve them temporarily. In order to improve for good, you need to solve problems at the systems level. Fix the inputs and the outputs will fix themselves.

The implicit assumption behind any goal is this: “Once I reach my goal, then I’ll be happy.” The problem with a goals-first mentality is that you’re continually putting happiness off until the next milestone. I’ve slipped into this trap so many times I’ve lost count. For years, happiness was always something for my future self to enjoy. I promised myself that once I successfully integrated AI into solving real-world problems, or after my YouTube channel about AI reached 100,000 subscribers, then I could finally relax.

Furthermore, goals create an “either-or” conflict: either you ac
# A SYSTEM OF ATOMIC HABITS

If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.

You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.

Focusing on the overall system, rather than a single goal, is one of the core themes of this book. It is also one of the deeper meanings behind the word atomic. By now, you’ve probably recognized the power of the tiny compounding effect of habits and how they contribute to the development of systems. Considering your ambitious transition from tech roles to a leading AI entrepreneur who manages both content creation and a tech startup, it becomes essential to refine and optimize your daily systems.

In your case, every morning you aim to rise at 5 AM to prioritize your AI projects and content creation on YouTube. This routine is an excellent illustration of an atomic habit contributing to a larger system of personal productivity and professional growth. If, however, small routine tasks or unscheduled interruptions from your living situation disrupt this habit, it challenges the efficiency of your system. To enhance the system, you might consider setting clearer boundaries with your girlfriend, thus minimizing distractions during your deep work phases.

Moreover, your desire to engage with the AI community and learn continuously can also be systematized. Perhaps allocating specific "learning hours" or "community interaction" periods during your week could help transform these goals into regular, beneficial habits. This structural approach ensures that even on days filled with routine tasks or lesser motivation, your system supports your progress toward becoming an AI thought leader.

A systems-first mentality provides the antidote. When you fall in love with the process rather than the product, you don’t have to wait to give yourself permission to be happy. You can be satisfied anytime your system is running. And a system can be successful in many different forms, not just the one you first envision.

Consider your fitness routine; some days might not allow for a full workout due to unexpected work tasks or personal commitments. However, maintaining the system might simply mean a shorter, more intense workout or a focus on flexibility training. This flexibility in your approach ensures adherence to your identity as a fit and active individual, regardless of the day's constraints.

Finally, a goal-oriented mindset can create a “yo-yo” effect. Many runners work hard for months, but as soon as they cross the finish line, they stop training. The race is no longer there to motivate them. When all of your hard work is focused on a particular goal, what is left to push you forward after you achieve it? This is why many people find themselves reverting to their old habits after accomplishing a goal.

Your identification with being a lifelong learner and leader in the AI industry means your goals are not finite. The aim isn't just to solve a problem or create a successful product. It's to maintain a continuous cycle of innovation, learning, and growth. Embedding daily habits that prioritise learning, content creation, and community engagement help maintain momentum, even after individual project completions.

The purpose of setting goals is to win the game. The purpose of building systems is to continue playing the game. True long-term thinking is goal-less thinking. It’s not about any single accomplishment. It is about the cycle of endless refinement and continuous improvement. Ultimately, it is your commitment to the process that will determine your progress.

By focusing on refining your daily habits across various aspects of your life—be it waking up earlier with ease, managing distractions, or systematically approaching routine tasks—you fortify the systems that uphold not just the immediate outcomes but your broader vision of innovation and leadership in the tech world.
You've likely realized that an atomic habit refers to a tiny change, a marginal gain, a 1 percent improvement. But atomic habits are not just any old habits, however small. They are little habits that are part of a larger system. Just as atoms are the building blocks of molecules, atomic habits are the building blocks of remarkable results.

Habits are like the atoms of our lives. Each one is a fundamental unit that contributes to your overall improvement. At first, these tiny routines seem insignificant, but soon they build on each other and fuel bigger wins that multiply to a degree that far outweighs the cost of their initial investment. They are both small and mighty. This is the meaning of the phrase atomic habits—a regular practice or routine that is not only small and easy to do but also the source of incredible power; a component of the system of compound growth.

## Chapter Summary

## How Your Habits Shape Your Identity (and Vice Versa)

Why is it easy to repeat bad habits and so hard to form good ones? Few things can have a more powerful impact on your life than improving your daily habits. And yet it is likely that this time next year you’ll be doing the same thing rather than something better.

It often feels difficult to keep good habits going for more than a few days, even with sincere effort and the occasional burst of motivation. Habits like exercise, meditation, journaling, and cooking are reasonable for a day or two and then become a hassle.

However, once your habits are established, they seem to stick around forever—especially the unwanted ones. Despite our best intentions, unhealthy habits like eating junk food, watching too much television, procrastinating, and smoking can feel impossible to break.

Changing our habits is challenging for two reasons: (1) we try to change the wrong thing, and (2) we try to change our habits in the wrong way. In this chapter, I'll address the first point. In the chapters that follow, I'll answer the second.

Our first motivation for habit change is often triggered by the desire for external validation rather than an internal commitment. For instance, wanting to improve your productivity in AI project development or content creation could be powered by the desire to be more recognized in your field, rather than purely for the satisfaction and internal fulfilment it brings. This external motivation can make habits harder to sustain.

Changing our habits effectively requires us to first change our identity. What you do is often a mirror of who you believe you are. We enact habits because we believe they are part of our identity. To truly improve your habits, begin by recognizing and reshaping who you believe you are and what you value.

For example, if you see yourself as someone who is a trendsetter in the AI industry and values deep, focused work, this identity can influence what you do daily. You might be more driven to maintain habits like avoiding distractions, scheduling deep work periods, and handling routine tasks efficiently. Moreover, by viewing yourself as a disciplined leader who respects stringent personal boundaries and values health, you could find maintaining a consistent wake-up routine and clean eating habits less of a chore and more as integral parts of your life. 

In sum, think of yourself as the type of person who achieves these things—someone who wakes up early, eats well, and leads innovatively in tech. Your habits will naturally realign to reflect this perception, facilitating a more seamless integration of those habits into your daily life. This alignment is not only about being efficient but also about being true to the person you aspire to be—a legendary tech maestro with commendable life discipline and work ethic.
### THREE LAYERS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE

Outcomes, processes, and identity are interconnected layers like the layers of an onion:

# Outcomes

- Changing your results: For instance, becoming a recognized figure in the AI field, achieving $1,000,000 profit per month in your business, having a legendary physique, and maximizing productivity and deep work without interruptions.

# Processes

- Changing your habits and systems: such as establishing a consistent waking time of 5 am, a structured daily routine for deep work on AI that remains undisturbed, and defined workout times to maintain your physical health.

# Identity

- Changing your beliefs: seeing yourself as a committed tech entrepreneur and a leader who is part of a bigger AI community. Believing in the importance of balancing life with meaningful relationships, personal wellness, and continual learning.

FIGURE 3: There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity.

Outcomes focus on what you get. Processes focus on what you do. Identity focuses on what you believe. When building habits that last and creating a system of 1 percent improvements, all levels of change serve their purpose. However, the effectiveness lies in the direction of the change.

Many individuals aim to change their habits by defining what they want to achieve, leading to outcome-based habits. Alternatively, building identity-based habits focuses on envisioning who we wish to become.

# Outcome-Based Habits vs. Identity-Based Habits

### FIGURE 4
- Outcome-based habits concentrate on the desired achievements, like becoming a successful tech entrepreneur, developing a commanding personal brand, and maintaining an athletic physique.
- Identity-based habits emphasize becoming the person who naturally aligns with these outcomes—someone deeply immersed and influential in the AI space, recognized for innovative solutions and thought leadership.

Imagine two entrepreneurs navigating the pressures and distractions of startup life. When faced with the temptation to digress into less critical tasks, the first entrepreneur says, “I need to focus, but I'll just quickly check my social media.” Although well-meaning, this approach indicates their identity still aligns with someone easily swayed by distractions.

Conversely, the second entrepreneur, deeply identifying with their role as a disciplined leader driven by effective habits, asserts, “No distractions; my focus is on developing AI solutions that matter.” This response reflects a commitment to a deep work philosophy, embodying the identity of one who values impactful work over fleeting distractions, similar to how you envision your ideal daily structure with protected time for deep focus—undistracted, principled, and result-oriented.
Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to be a leading tech entrepreneur (outcome) and if I master AI and produce engaging content, then I'll achieve that status (process).” They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions.

For you, it’s pivotal to shift from seeing yourself just as someone who’s technologically proficient to being an inspiring leader and influential voice in the AI community. This identity change is crucial because it influences every decision you make—from your daily routine to the way you interact on social media.

Behind every system of actions are a system of beliefs. In your case, the transition from being a technical expert to an influential tech entrepreneur isn't just about acquiring more knowledge or improving content on YouTube and Twitter. It involves embracing a mindset focused on leadership, innovation, and community engagement. This is similar to how political systems operate based on underlying beliefs. A democracy encourages behaviors like voting and civic engagement, supported by beliefs in freedom and participation. Likewise, your entrepreneurial journey must be supported by beliefs in continuous learning, community building, and innovation.

A similar pattern exists whether we are discussing individuals, organizations, or societies. For instance, your day-to-day habits should align with your aspirations of becoming a renowned tech leader. Observing, networking, and continuous learning are habits that should be as routine as your morning coffee. There’s an identity behind the habits that you are trying to cultivate.

Behavior that is incongruent with the self will not last. You may want more influence and success in the tech world, but if your identity is rooted in just being a programmer or a consumer of information, you'll continue to be pulled towards passive learning rather than active creation and leadership. If you view yourself as a tech entrepreneur, you'll be drawn to creating, influencing, and leading. It's hard to change your habits if you never change the underlying beliefs that dictate these habits. Begin by firmly seeing yourself as the tech maestro and leader you aspire to be. This new self-view will make it easier for you to adopt the behaviors that align with this identity, like consistent content creation, strategic networking, and assertive decision-making in your business ventures.
- The story of Brian Clark, an entrepreneur from Boulder, Colorado, provides a good example. "For as long as I can remember, I've chewed my fingernails," Clark told me. "It started as a nervous habit when I was young, and then morphed into an undesirable grooming ritual. One day, I resolved to stop chewing my nails until they grew out a bit. Through mindful willpower alone, I managed to do it."

- Then, Clark did something surprising.

- "I asked my wife to schedule my first-ever manicure," he said. "My thought was that if I started paying to maintain my nails, I wouldn't chew them. And it worked, but not for the monetary reason. What happened was the manicure made my fingers look really nice for the first time. The manicurist even said that—other than the chewing—I had really healthy, attractive nails. Suddenly, I was proud of my fingernails. And even though that's something I had never aspired to, it made all the difference. I've never chewed my nails since; not even a single close call. And it's because I now take pride in properly caring for them."

- The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It's one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this. It's something very different to say I'm the type of person who is this.

- Just as you, a tech entrepreneur and content creator, might shift your identity towards someone deeply committed to disciplined mornings. Imagine you began understanding yourself not just as someone trying to wake up early, but as a "5 AM Club Member," someone who thrives in the silence of early mornings, harnessing this quiet time for deep work on AI projects or creating valuable content before the world wakes up. This reshaped identity could deeply influence your approach to daily routines, making early rises a source of pride and a crucial element of your professional success.

- The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habits associated with it. If you see yourself as a leader in the AI tech space, you'll intensively grow and protect your periods of deep work. If you identify as a fitness enthusiast who values strength and vitality, you will find consistency in your daily workouts, regardless of your fluctuating schedule. This sense of identity not only fosters commitment but transforms activities like waking early or resisting social media distractions into affirmations of who you are.

True behavior change is identity change. You might start a habit because of external motivations—like earning more money or pushing your startup to succeed. However, true change is not about the outcomes; it's about deeply integrating those practices into who you are. Thus, aligning your daily actions with this desired identity can propel you toward the consistency and excellence you seek in your personal and professional life.
bit because of motivation, but the only reason you’ll stick with one is that it becomes part of your identity. Anyone can convince themselves to visit the gym or eat healthy once or twice, but if you don’t shift the belief behind the behavior, then it is hard to stick with long-term changes. Improvements are only temporary until they become part of who you are.

- The goal is not to read a book, the goal is to become a reader.
- The goal is not to run a marathon, the goal is to become a runner.
- The goal is not to learn an instrument, the goal is to become a musician.

For instance, you aspire to wake up at 5 a.m. consistently and establish a powerful, uninterrupted morning routine focused on AI advancements and content creation. By adjusting your identity to see yourself as an "early riser" and a "disciplined tech entrepreneur," you align your actions with this identity every morning.

Your behaviors are usually a reflection of your identity. What you do is an indication of the type of person you believe that you are—either consciously or nonconsciously. Research has shown that once a person believes in a particular aspect of their identity, they are more likely to act in alignment with that belief. For example, if you begin to truly view yourself as a "health-conscious eater," your daily choices of oats, salads, and steak align naturally with this identity, reducing the effort required to choose them over less healthy options.

Similarly, the person who incorporates exercise into their identity doesn’t have to convince themselves to train. Doing the right thing is easy. After all, when your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

Like all aspects of habit formation, this, too, is a double-edged sword. When working for you, identity change can be a powerful force for self-improvement. When working against you, though, identity change can be a curse. Once you have adopted an identity, it can be easy to let your allegiance to it impact your ability to change. Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity.

- "I'm terrible with directions."
- "I'm not a morning person."
- "I'm bad at remembering people's names."
- "I'm always late."
- "I'm not good with technology."

To transform these self-limiting beliefs, start by rewriting the narrative. You might currently say, "I'm not good at sticking to a schedule," but as you make efforts to consistently define when and how tasks are handled based on your goals as an AI entrepreneur, your internal narrative should shift to, "I am someone who thrives on a structured schedule and deep work." This empowers you, driving the alignment of daily habits with your true aspirations.
"I'm horrible at math."
- ... and a thousand other variations.

When you have repeated a story to yourself for years, it is easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact. In time, you begin to resist certain actions because "that's not who I am." There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs. You find whatever way you can to avoid contradicting yourself.

The more deeply a thought or action is tied to your identity, the more difficult it is to change it. It can feel comfortable to believe what your culture believes (group identity) or to do what upholds your self-image (personal identity), even if it's wrong. The biggest barrier to positive change at any level—individual, team, society—is identity conflict. Good habits can make rational sense, but if they conflict with your identity, you will fail to put them into action.

On any given day, you may struggle with your habits because you're too busy or too tired or too overwhelmed or hundreds of other reasons. Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can't get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.

This brings us to an important question: If your beliefs and worldview play such an important role in your behavior, where do they come from in the first place? How, exactly, is your identity formed? And how can you emphasize new aspects of your identity that serve you and gradually erase the pieces that hinder you?

### THE TWO-STEP PROCESS TO CHANGING YOUR IDENTITY

Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.

- More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. For instance, when you think of yourself as someone who is not a "morning person," this identity can make waking up early at 5 am consistently feel like a struggle against your nature. By gradually shifting this self-perception—beginning perhaps with a habit of setting deliberate and rewarding morning rituals—you start rewriting the narrative. This could be as simple as the rewarding early morning quiet time for reading, which you enjoy, thus reinforcing the habit and reshaping your identity around morning productivity.

Similarly, if you view yourself as someone who is continually distracted by social media, consider cultivating the identity of someone who engages with digital tools purposefully. Setting boundaries, such as scheduled social media check-ins aligned with productive outputs, integrates this new self-concept into regular practices. Each action you take is a vote for the type of person you aspire to become—a focused and disciplined tech entrepreneur. Rather than seeing actions like avoiding unnecessary social media browsing as depriving yourself, view them as affirming your identity as an individual who harnesses technology to enhance productivity, not hamper it. 

By embracing these concepts, each small, seemingly insignificant behavior begins to set the foundation for who you choose to become, cementing your identity not just as a tech enthusiast but as a pioneer in the AI field and a balanced individual who values both personal growth and meaningful relationships. Remember, every habit not only reflects your identity but also shapes it, making them crucial to your evolution as both a leader and innovator.
### 🪞 To form good habits, make them a part of your identity

Our habits should be a part of our identity and the starting point of building it. Most of us get this wrong – we start with outcomes and work backwards towards our identity. But when a habit comes from who we are, it serves as the best form of intrinsic motivation.

For example, as a tech entrepreneur deeply passionate about AI, instead of just focusing on completing a project or creating content as an item to be checked off your list (outcome -> identity), start thinking: I am an innovator and educator in artificial intelligence (identity->outcome). So naturally, as someone who pushes the boundaries of tech, I engage daily in AI project development and content creation, understanding these activities not just as tasks, but as expressions of my identity. This shift will not just impact how you see your work but enhance your commitment and the quality of your output.

Most people don’t even consider identity change when they set out to improve. They just think, “I want to succeed in my tech projects (outcome) and if I focus enough on AI development, then I will succeed (process).”

They set goals and determine the actions they should take to achieve those goals without considering the beliefs that drive their actions.

They never shift the way they look at themselves, and they don’t realize that their old identity can sabotage their new plans for change. Behind every system of actions is a system of beliefs.

- The goal is not to code for hours; the goal is to become a visionary tech developer.
- The goal is not to just share content; the goal is to become an influential voice in the AI community.
- The goal is not to read a book; the goal is to become a lifelong learner and thought leader in your field.

Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity.

- “I’m just a technician.”
- “I’m not a morning person.”
- “I’m too busy to keep learning every day.”
- “I can’t manage my time efficiently.”
- “I’m not good at maintaining work-life balance.” … and a thousand other variations.

When you have repeated a story to yourself for many years, it’s easy to slide into these mental grooves and accept them as a fact.

> Over the long run, however, the real reason you fail to stick with habits is that your self-image gets in the way. This is why you can't get too attached to one version of your identity. Progress requires unlearning. Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity.
> 

> Your identity emerges out of your habits. You are not born with preset beliefs. Every belief, including those about yourself, is learned and conditioned through experience.
> 

More precisely, your habits are how you embody your identity. When you commit to waking up at 5 a.m. and treating this as a non-negotiable part of your day, you embody the identity of a disciplined entrepreneur. Each system you put in place to eliminate distractions or prioritize essential tasks can strengthen your identity as a focused and effective leader.

Whatever your identity is right now, you only believe it because you have proof of it. If you prepare for major meetings thoroughly, you have evidence that you are a detail-oriented person. If you consistently share knowledgeable content on AI, you have evidence that you are an expert in your field.

This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolution of the self.

Each habit is like a suggestion: “Hey, maybe this is who I am.” If you manage your time efficiently, then perhaps you are the type of person who is a master of productivity. If you interact frequently and meaningfully with your community online and offline, perhaps you are the type of person who values connections and growth through collaboration.

*Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.*

Building better habits isn't about littering your day with life hacks. It’s about making profound choices that reinforce your desired identity, not just once, but consistently, compounding positive behaviors that align deeply with who you aspire to be, from a groundbreaking AI innovator to a fitness-conscious individual. Notice, it's not about transformative leaps; it's about incremental alignment.
- contribute most of the evidence that shapes your identity. In this way, the process of building habits is actually the process of becoming yourself.
- This is a gradual evolution. We do not change by snapping our fingers and deciding to be someone entirely new. We change bit by bit, day by day, habit by habit. We are continually undergoing microevolutions of the self.

- Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the

Evidence of your new identity. This is one reason why meaningful change does not require radical change. Small habits can make a meaningful difference by providing evidence of a new identity. And if a change is meaningful, it actually is big. That’s the paradox of making small improvements.

Putting this all together, you can see that habits are the path to changing your identity. The most practical way to change who you are is to change what you do.

- Each time you code a new algorithm, you are a programmer.
- Each time you engage with the AI community or learn from a peer, you are an industry expert.
- Each time you successfully manage your time to integrate work and personal life, perhaps by respecting your designated work hours and thereby balancing time with Anastasiia, you are becoming the organized, successful individual who values personal connections.
- Each time you stick to your goal of waking up at 5 am and provide a quality morning routine like reviewing your affirmation board, you reinforce your identity as a disciplined, focused entrepreneur.

Each habit not only gets results but also teaches you something far more important: to trust yourself. You start to believe you can actually accomplish these things. When the votes mount up and the evidence begins to change, the story you tell yourself begins to change as well.

Of course, it works the opposite way, too. Every time you choose to perform a bad habit, it’s a vote for that identity. The good news is that you don’t need to be perfect. In any election, the
## It is a simple two-step process:

1. Decide the type of person you want to be.
2. Prove it to yourself with small wins.

First, decide who you want to be. This holds at any level—as an individual, as a team, as a community, as a nation. What do you want to stand for? What are your principles and values? Who do you wish to become?

These are big questions, and many people aren’t sure where to begin—but they do know what kind of results they want: to get six-pack abs or to feel less anxious or to double their salary. That’s fine. Start there and work backward from the results you want to the type of person who could get those results. Ask yourself, “Who is the type of person that could get the outcome I want?” Who is the type of person that could lose forty pounds? Who is the type of person that could learn a new language? Who is the type of person that could run a successful start-up?

For example, “Who is the type of person who could write a book?” It’s probably someone who is consistent and reliable. Now your focus shifts from writing a book (outcome-based) to being the type of person who is consistent and reliable (identity-based).

## This process can lead to beliefs like:

  - “I’m the kind of tech entrepreneur who consistently innovates and applies deep learning to solve real-world problems.”
  - “I’m the kind of content creator who delivers regular, high-quality AI-focused videos that empower and educate my audience.”
  - “I'm the kind of partner who supports and respects the spatial and temporal boundaries within my relationship, enhancing focus and productivity.”

- Once you have a handle on the type of person you want to be, tailor each habit to fortify that identity. If your belief is that you are a ground-breaking tech entrepreneur, start each day by reading the latest research in AI before you even think to check social media. Convert your social media habit into a controlled, scheduled activity that supplements your primary tasks, such as sharing AI breakthroughs or networking with other tech leaders, forming a more disciplined and purposeful online engagement.

By casting these new votes for a better habit, you're not just aspiring to change; you are incrementally redefining who you are, aligning more closely with the vision of the person you aspire to be—a transformation that resonates deeply across both your professional and personal realms.
to be, you can begin taking small steps to reinforce your desired identity. I have a friend who lost over 100 pounds by asking herself, “What would a healthy person do?” All day long, she would use this question as a guide. Would a healthy person walk or take a cab? Would a healthy person order a burrito or a salad? She figured if she acted like a healthy person long enough, eventually she would become that person. She was right. Applying this to your own life, you can start by questioning your daily decisions: What would a successful tech entrepreneur do? Would he switch tasks or focus on his AI project without distractions? Would he spend an extra hour fine-tuning his code or procrastinate by checking social media?

- The concept of identity-based habits is our first introduction to another key theme in this book: feedback loops. Your habits shape your identity, and your identity shapes your habits. It’s a two-way street. The formation of all habits is a feedback loop (a concept we will explore in depth in the next chapter), but it’s important to let your values, principles, and identity drive the loop rather than your results. For instance, each time you decide to work uninterrupted in your cabinet or stick to your schedule in Dubai despite disruptions, you are reinforcing your identity as a focused and resilient entrepreneur.

- THE REAL REASON HABITS MATTER

Identity change is the North Star of habit change. The remainder of this book will provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to build better habits in yourself, your family, your team, your company, and anywhere else you wish. 

- But the true question is: “Are you becoming the type of person you want to become?” The first step is not what or how, but who. You need to know who you want to be. Otherwise, your quest for change is like a boat without a rudder. And that’s why we are starting here. For you, defining who you want to be could begin with envisioning the tech maestro who influences the field of AI, maintains a balanced lifestyle, and effectively manages his time between creating and personal life.

- You have the power to change your beliefs about yourself. Your identity is not set in stone. You have a choice in every moment. You can choose the identity you want to reinforce today with the habits you choose today. And this brings us to the deeper purpose of this book and the real reason habits matter. For example, choosing consistently to dedicate mornings to high-focus work activities and engaging in social media at designated times can transform your productivity and align you more closely with the identity of an effective entrepreneur.

- Building better habits isn’t about littering your day with life hacks. It’s not about flossing one tooth each night or taking a cold shower each morning or wearing the same outfit each day. It’s not about micro-actions without context. Instead, it's about integrating actions that reinforce your identity as a disciplined, health-conscious, and innovative tech entrepreneur. Each decision you make, from the time you wake up at 5 AM, to sticking to your workout schedule, to managing how you engage on social media, molds the clay of your identity towards becoming the elite entrepreneur you aspire to be.
## Chapter Summary

- There are three levels of change: outcome change, process change, and identity change. Understanding these levels can guide you, a young tech entrepreneur eager to refine both your professional and personal habits, towards profound transformation.

- The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become. For instance, instead of just aiming to be proficient in AI, consider how adopting the identity of an AI innovator shapes your daily activities and decisions.

- Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. Each day when you choose to delve into AI research over indulging in distractions, you cast a powerful vote towards becoming that influential tech leader you aspire to be.

- Becoming the best version of yourself requires you to continuously edit your beliefs, and to upgrade and expand your identity. This could mean evolving from just a tech enthusiast to an industry leader who contributes critically to discussions and innovation in AI.

- The real reason habits matter is not because they can get you better results (although they can do that), but because they can change your beliefs about yourself. Believing you're an innovator can drive you to behave like one, influencing your interactions and the opportunities you attract.

### How to Build Better Habits in 4 Simple Steps

1. In 1905, a psychologist named Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment that would lay the foundation for our understanding of how habits form and the rules that guide our behavior. Thorndike was interested in studying the behavior of animals, and he started by working with cats.

2. He would place each cat inside a device known as a puzzle box. The box was designed so that the cat could escape through a door "by some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord, pressing a lever, or stepping on a platform." For example, one box contained a lever that, when pressed, would open a door on the side of the box. Once the door had been opened, the cat could dart out and run over to a bowl of food.

3. Most cats wanted to escape as soon as they were placed inside the box. They would poke their nose into the corners, stick their paws through any openings, and press against the sides. The movements were frantic at first, without any plan or insight into what might work. But over successive trials, these actions became more deliberate. As a young entrepreneur, imagine each attempt as analogous to iterating on your AI projects or refining your daily routines. At first, your efforts might seem scattered and ineffective—like checking social media excessively or working inconsistently. But gradually, you'll find the best strategies, such as scheduling specific times for deep work or setting strict boundaries for personal interruptions that maximize your productivity and success.

4. Thorndike noted that cats gradually learned to escape more quickly. He described this phenomenon as the "Law of Effect", which states that behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated, whereas those that produce discomfort are less likely to be performed. You can leverage this in your own habit formation by attaching positive reinforcements to productive behaviors. For instance, after a successful day of coding or content creation, you might reward yourself with a wellness activity like a session in an infrared sauna. Conversely, ineffective or distracting habits can be paired with less appealing outcomes, reinforcing your drive to avoid them. This principle will help solidify your identity as a disciplined and innovative tech entrepreneur, aligning your actions with your ultimate goals of transformation and industry leadership.
4. Thorndike tracked the behavior of each cat across many trials. In the beginning, the animals moved around the box at random. But as soon as the lever had been pressed and the door opened, the process of learning began. Gradually, each cat learned to associate the action of pressing the lever with the reward of escaping the box and getting to the food.

5. After twenty to thirty trials, this behavior became so automatic and habitual that the cat could escape within a few seconds. For example, Thorndike noted, "Cat 12 took the following times to perform the act: 160 seconds, 30 seconds, 90 seconds, 60, 15, 28, 20, 30, 22, 11, 15, 20, 12, 10, 14, 10, 8, 8, 5, 10, 8, 6, 6, 7."

6. During the first three trials, the cat escaped in an average of 1.5 minutes. During the last three trials, it escaped in an average of 6.3 seconds. With practice, each cat made fewer errors and their actions became quicker and more automatic. Rather than repeat the same mistakes, the cat began to cut straight to the solution.

From his studies, Thorndike described the learning process by stating,

“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences tend to be repeated and those that produce unpleasant consequences are less likely to be repeated.” His work provides the perfect starting point for discussing how habits form in our own lives. It also provides answers to some fundamental questions like: What are habits? And why does the brain bother building them at all?

**WHY YOUR BRAIN BUILDS HABITS**

A habit is a behavior that has been repeated enough times to become automatic.

The process of habit formation begins with trial and error. Whenever you encounter a new situation in life, your brain has to make a decision. How do I respond to this? The first time you come across a problem, you’re not sure how to solve it.

Imagine your initial attempts at managing your daily schedule in your tech entrepreneurship journey. Initially, it's like the cat in Thorndike's puzzle box; you may have tried different methods to optimize your deep work phases, such as using different productivity apps or changing your work environment by moving to a quieter room or adjusting the lighting in your cabinet. Over time, you’ll discover which cues help you to start your deep work and which rewards satisfy you the most, such as the pleasure of ticking off a significant task related to AI development or creating compelling new content for your YouTube channel. 

This trial and error process helps to fine-tune your actions until they become more automatic, turning them into a robust system, much like the cat learning to directly press the lever to escape. Just as the cat optimizes its actions to achieve its goals more efficiently, you can optimize your daily routine to engage in deep work with fewer distractions, thus making habitual progress toward your goals of becoming a prominent figure in the AI tech space.
Like Thorndike’s cat, you're exploring various approaches in your endeavors - from AI solutions to personal branding on social media. While navigating your day-to-day activities, your brain is engaged in high levels of neurological activity. You painstakingly sift through extensive information on AI, machine learning, and content creation, trying to determine the most effective strategies to employ.

Occasionally, you find a rewarding tactic—a productivity hack, perhaps a new way of scheduling your day that meshes well with living in Dubai, or a particularly successful AI project or YouTube video that boosts your follower engagement. This discovery is crucial. 

You’re feeling anxious, and decide that tweaking your work environment to minimize distractions helps you focus better. After a long day of developing AI solutions, a structured workout or a session in an ice bath rejuvenates you. These explorations ultimately lead to significant realizations—**BAM**, a reward.

As you stumble upon these unexpected rewards, your intuition sharpens for the next time. You swiftly begin to recognize the events, or cues, that precede successful outcomes. Wait a minute—that felt good. Did posting AI content at a peak viewer time drive more engagement? Did structuring deep work periods in the early morning when your mental energy is highest prove more effective?

This feedback loop forms the backbone of all human behavior: test a strategy, face possible failure, glean insights, and adjust your approach. With practice, unnecessary and unhelpful tactics diminish, while beneficial actions become more pronounced. That's how personalized habits take shape.

Each time you confront a recurring challenge—whether it's maintaining focus while working from home, managing your time to include health and wellness practices, or navigating the complexities of entrepreneurial life—your brain automates the problem-solving process. As behavioral scientist Jason Hreha notes, “Habits are, simply, reliable solutions to recurring problems in our environment.”

Through these developments, activity in your cognitive processing begins to wane. You grow adept at identifying cues signalling successful outcomes, minimizing the need to reassess every angle. When faced with a familiar scenario, your mind quickly bypasses the exhaustive analysis, implementing mental shortcuts: if this scenario arises, then that action follows. Now, whenever you feel the pull of distraction, your previously established routines guide you back on track—whether it's powering down your phone to avoid social media or setting strict office hours to prevent interruptions.

By deploying this systematic approach, you optimize your daily routines, diverting from the exhausting cycle of trial and error to adhering to personalized, efficient cognitive scripts. These habit loops transition into automatic responses, executed whenever the appropriate situation recurs, supporting your journey to becoming an AI maestro and an influential techpreneur.
- Habits are mental shortcuts learned from experience. In a sense, a habit is just a memory of the steps you previously followed to solve a problem in the past. For example, just like when you automate your morning routine to include reviewing your visualization/affirmation board, this habit primes your day for focused success, aligning your actions with your identity as an aspiring tech entrepreneur deeply engaged in the AI field. Whenever the conditions are right, you can draw on this memory and automatically apply the same solution, much like how you recall the best coding practices when faced with a software problem.

- Habit formation is incredibly useful because the conscious mind is the bottleneck of the brain. It can only pay attention to one problem at a time. As a result, your brain is always working to preserve your conscious attention for whatever task is most essential. Whenever possible, the conscious mind likes to pawn off tasks to the nonconscious mind to do automatically. This is precisely what happens when a habit is formed. For instance, setting a specific time and procedure for daily workouts can turn them into a habit, saving you the mental effort of deciding when and how to exercise each day, thus freeing up mental energy to focus on high-priority tasks like your AI projects or content creation.

- Despite their efficiency, some people still wonder about the benefits of habits. The argument goes like this: “Will habits make my life dull? I don’t want to pigeonhole myself into a lifestyle I don’t enjoy. Doesn’t so much routine take away the vibrancy and spontaneity of life?” Hardly. Such questions set up a false dichotomy. They make you think that you have to choose between building habits and attaining freedom. In reality, the two complement each other. Habits do not restrict freedom. They create it. Just as your goal to consistently wake up at 5 am and go to bed at 8:30 pm can be viewed as restrictive, these habits actually facilitate a higher degree of freedom by structuring your day in a way that maximizes productivity and personal satisfaction. In fact, the people who don’t have their habits handled are often the ones with the least amount of freedom. Without good financial habits, you will always be struggling for the next dollar. Without good health habits, you will always seem to be short on energy. If you feel overwhelmed by the endless notifications and demands from social media, developing the habit of checking these platforms only at designated times can regain control of your time and energy, just like structuring your AI learning and project development has sharpened your focus and efficiency in your professional pursuits. Without good learning habits, you will always feel like you’re behind the curve in the rapidly evolving tech world. If you’re always being forced to make decisions about sim
# THE SCIENCE OF HOW HABITS WORK

The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward. Breaking it down into these fundamental parts can help us understand what a habit is, how it works, and how to improve it.

- CUE
- CRAVING
- RESPONSE
- REWARD

![IMAGE](IMAGE_URL)

FIGURE S: All habits proceed through four stages in the same order: cue, craving, response, and reward.

This four-step pattern is the backbone of every habit, and your brain runs through these steps in the same order each time.

First, there is the cue. The cue triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. It is a bit of information that predicts a reward. For instance, as a tech entrepreneur, the sight of your home office or a specific startup-related book might be the cue that it's time to focus on your AI project or crafting your next impactful tweet.

Your mind is continuously analyzing your internal and external environment for hints of where rewards are located. Because the cue is the first indication that we’re close to a reward, it naturally leads to a craving.

Cravings are the second step, and they are the motivational force behind every habit. Without some level of motivation, no action takes place. In your case, the craving might be the rush of solving a complex problem with your AI solutions or the satisfaction and social validation from sharing a well-received piece of content on YouTube. This craving motivates you to continue engaging in deep work despite potential distractions, fulfilling that need for intellectual stimulation and public acknowledgment.

The response is the actual habit you perform, which can be as simple as opening your programming tools and starting to debug or record a new tutorial for posting online. For you, the response should be as streamlined as possible to reduce friction and maintain productivity. For example, having your tools laid out in your home office workspace before you start your day can reduce time wasted and harness your craving more efficiently.

Lastly, the reward is what your brain likes, which helps it remember the “habit loop” in the future. For you, a reward might be watching key metrics like user engagement or follower counts increase due to your daily posting on social media. Or, on a personal level, a reward might come from your structured break times, where a planned relaxation or meditation session amplifies recovery, thus enhancing your ability to return to high-focus tasks in AI development or content creation.

By identifying and manipulating these four steps in the structure of your daily routines and entrepreneurial endeavors, you can set the foundation for habits that foster success and well-being while simultaneously pushing professional growth and personal satisfaction.
- or desire—without craving a change—we have no reason to act. What you crave is not the habit itself but the change in state it delivers. You do not crave smoking a cigarette, you crave the feeling of relief it provides. You are not motivated by brushing your teeth but rather by the feeling of a clean mouth. You do not want to turn on the television, you want to be entertained. Every craving is linked to a desire to change your internal state. This is an important point that we will discuss in detail later.

Cravings differ from person to person. In your case, you might not crave the act of checking social media, but you crave the brief diversion it provides from your intense focus on AI and content creation. For you, watching a video or scrolling through Twitter might serve as a mental break, however, it's crucial to recognize whether this diversion supports or detracts from your ultimate objectives.

- The third step is the response. The response is the actual habit you perform, which can take the form of a thought or an action. Whether a response occurs depends on how motivated you are and how much friction is associated with the behavior. If monitoring and responding to Twitter notifications is easily accessible during your work hours, you're more likely to engage in it. Creating friction by keeping your phone in another room while working could help you focus better on your AI projects. Your structured environment in your home office should facilitate such habits that align with your entrepreneurial goals.

- Finally, the response delivers a reward. Rewards are the end goal of every habit. The cue is about noticing the reward. The craving is about wanting the reward. The response is about obtaining the reward. We chase rewards because they serve two purposes: (1) they satisfy us and (2) they teach us.

- The first purpose of rewards is to satisfy your craving. Yes, rewards provide benefits such as the momentary pleasure from a social media check, but consider integrating better rewards that align with your long-term goals. For example, after a focused AI development session, a planned break could be a brief walk or meditation moment, not only offering relaxation but also enhancing your productivity and creativity. This aligns more effectively with your identity as a disciplined tech entrepreneur and supports your vision of leading a balanced life that includes time for recovery and personal care.
- Second, rewards teach us which actions are worth remembering in the future. Your brain is a reward detector. As you go about your life, your sensory nervous system is continuously monitoring which actions satisfy your desires and deliver pleasure. Feelings of pleasure and disappointment are part of the feedback mechanism that helps your brain distinguish useful actions from useless ones. Rewards close the feedback loop and complete the habit cycle.

For instance, imagine after achieving a week of waking up at 5 am and effectively beginning work on your AI projects, you reward yourself with a scheduled session of ice bath and sauna—activities you greatly enjoy. This intentional reward not only gives you immediate pleasure but also reinforces the behavior of starting your day early, making it a habit you're eager to continue.

- If a behavior is insufficient in any of the four stages, it will not become a habit. Eliminate the cue and your habit will never start. Reduce the craving and you won’t experience enough motivation to act. Make the behavior difficult and you won’t be able to do it. And if the reward fails to satisfy your desire, then you’ll have no reason to do it again in the future. Without the first three steps, a behavior will not occur. Without all four, a behavior will not be repeated.

To avoid distractions and improve focus on your deep work, you could alter your environment to eliminate cues related to social media during work hours—perhaps by using apps that block your access until 1 PM. This removes the cue of notifications popping up and reduces the craving to check updates.

- **CUE CRAVING**

- **REWARD RESPONSE**

**FIGURE 6:** The four stages of habit are best described as a feedback loop. They form an endless cycle that is running every moment you are alive. This “habit loop” is continually scanning the environment, predicting what will happen next, trying out different responses, and learning from the results.

Consider your evening routine; perhaps you have established a cue of dimming the lights in your apartment which triggers a craving for winding down, thus you respond by getting ready for bed at 8:30 PM, creating a peaceful environment with Anastasiia. The reward is a good night's sleep which satisfies your craving for rest, reinforcing the cue for the next evening.

In summary, the cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue. Together, these four steps form a neurological feedback loop—cue, craving, response, reward; cue, craving, response, reward—that ultimately allows you to create autom
   
## Problem phase

- Cue
- Craving

## Solution phase

- Response
- Reward

All behavior is driven by the desire to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is that you notice something good and you want to obtain it. Sometimes the problem is that you are experiencing pain and you want to relieve it. Either way, the purpose of every habit is to solve the problems you face.

In the table on the following page, you can see a few examples of what this looks like in real life.

Imagine walking into a dark room and flipping on the light switch. You have performed this simple habit so many times that it occurs without thinking. You proceed through all four stages in the fraction of a second. The urge to act strikes you without thinking.

## Problem phase

- Cue: Your phone buzzes with a new text message.
- Craving: You want to learn the contents of the message.

## Solution phase

- Response: You grab your phone and read the text.
- Reward: You satisfy your craving to read the message. Grabbing your phone becomes associated with your phone buzzing.

## Problem phase

- Cue: You are answering emails.
- Craving: You begin to feel overwhelmed by the volume and complexity, mirroring the clutter of unattended small tasks you often face.

## Solution phase

- Response: Instead of continuing in a reactive mode, you decide to set a specific time later to address emails in batches, using a focused approach. This practice is similar to how you've contemplated dedicating certain times for handling routine tasks, allowing you to focus more deeply on your AI development tasks during your prime creative hours.
- Reward: You experience reduced stress and increased productivity, affirming your identity as an effective, smart tech entrepreneur who manages his time and energy wisely. This success in managing your work environment reinforces your desired identity and enhances your capability to tackle more significant projects with a clearer mind.
## Solution phase

- Response: You bite your nails.
- Reward: You satisfy your craving to reduce stress. Biting your nails becomes associated with answering email.

## Problem phase

- Cue: You wake up at 5 am.
- Craving: You want to feel alert and dive into your AI projects.

## Solution phase

- Response: You drink a cup of coffee.
- Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel alert. Drinking coffee becomes associated with starting your productive day.

## Problem phase

- Cue: You smell the aroma of fresh coffee from your kitchen as you work from your home office.
- Craving: You begin to crave a coffee break.

## Solution phase

- Response: You take a short break to enjoy a coffee, allowing your mind a rest.
- Reward: You satisfy your craving for a break. Taking a coffee break becomes associated with recharging during your work sessions.

## Problem phase

- Cue: You hit a stumbling block on a project at work, especially when working with complex AI models.
- Craving: You feel stuck and want to relieve your frustration.

## Solution phase

- Response: You pull out your phone and check social media for a quick diversion.
- Reward: You satisfy your craving to feel relieved. Checking social media becomes associated with feeling stalled at work.

## Problem phase

- Cue: You walk into your dark home office early in the morning.
- Craving: You want to be able to see and start working efficiently.

## Solution phase

- Response: You flip the light switch.
- Reward: You satisfy your craving to see and dive into your work. Turning on the light switch becomes associated with starting your productive workday.

By the time we become adults, we rarely notice the habits that are running our lives. Most of us never give a second thought to the fact that we tie the same shoe first each morning, unplug the toaster after each use, or always change into comfortable clothes after getting home from work. After decades of mental programming, we automatically slip into these patterns of thinking and acting.

**THE FOUR LAWS OF BEHAVIOR CHANGE**

In the following chapters, we will see time and again how the four stages of cue, craving, response, and reward influence nearly everything we do each day.
Certainly! Here is a personalized rewrite of the discussed section, incorporating your specific context:

## How to Create a Good Habit

- **Make it Obvious**: As you focus on growing your expertise in AI and content creation, ensuring that your working environment is free from distractions is key. Design your separate cabinet in a way that maximizes productivity. Place motivational quotes from leading AI innovators and reminders of your daily goals visually around the room. This constant visual reinforcement makes your priorities clear each day.

- **Make it Attractive**: Tie your sessions of deep work to a rewarding outcome. For instance, after a morning of productive deep work, allow yourself a break to enjoy a wellness activity like stretching or a quick ice bath session. Associating work with a pleasurable activity can significantly enhance your motivation.

- **Make it Easy**: Reduce friction in starting your most important work, especially during your peak hours of productivity. Prepare your workspace the night before, set out your necessary tools, and perhaps pre-outline your content for the next day. By making the start almost effortless, you're more likely to dive right into deep work without hesitation.

- **Make it Satisfying**: After completing a set of important tasks, take a short, planned break to check in with Anastasiia or treat yourself to a healthy snack. These small rewards will provide immediate satisfaction and reinforce your motivation to continue embracing productive habits.

## How to Break a Bad Habit

- **Inversion of Make it Obvious**: To combat distractions from social media, develop strategies to make these platforms less accessible during your designated work hours. Use apps that block distracting sites or put your phone in another room. Removing these cues from your environment helps in breaking the habit of checking social media.

- **Inversion of Make it Attractive**: Make the process of engaging in distractions feel unattractive. You can automate most routine tasks or delegate them, leaving your main productive hours free for important projects. Knowing that these tasks are being handled can make the desire to escape into distractions like social media less appealing.

- **Inversion of Make it Easy**: Create barriers to engaging in bad habits. For instance, if snoozing in the morning is a challenge, place your alarm across the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off—making it harder to succumb to the temptation of sleeping in.

- **Inversion of Make it Satisfying**: To effectively handle the snack habit, keep unhealthy snacks out of the house and have only healthy options like nuts and fruits available. The immediate dissatisfaction of not finding a typical treat can reinforce your decision to adhere to healthy eating habits.

These tailored approaches leverage the Four Laws of Behavior Change directly within your own context, promoting a more disciplined schedule, focused work environment, and healthier lifestyle. Empowering yourself with these customized strategies ensures not just temporary changes but a sustainable transformation in alignment with your identity as an emerging tech entrepreneur and influencer in the AI space.
**THE 1ST LAW**

## Make It Obvious

- The Man Who Didn’t Look Right

The renowned cognitive psychologist Gary Klein once told me a story about a woman who attended a family gathering. She had spent years working as a paramedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father-in-law and got very concerned.

“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.

Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied, “Well, I don’t like your looks, either.”

“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”

A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after an examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery and was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-law’s intuition, he could have died.

What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending heart attack? When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending blood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the surface of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution of blood in the face. After many years of working with people with heart failure, the woman had unknowingly developed the ability to recognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it was that she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she knew something was wrong.  

Especially applicable to your life is understanding that your daily environment can have obvious cues linked directly to the behaviors you deploy without even realizing it. As you've made a big transition moving from Amsterdam to Dubai, the patterns and routines you had established there might not easily translate to your new environment. The initial period in any new setting is crucial; it sets the stage for forming new habits. Right now, automatic behaviors haven't fully set in, which makes it the perfect time to craft and adhere to the habits you want to establish, much like the paramedic who could read the subtle signs of a heart condition.

Just as she developed a keen sense of diagnosis through repeated exposure and attention to detail, you can train yourself to spot the less obvious habits that may be forming due to your new environment. For instance, if you find yourself frequently distracted, look around in your workspace: have you made it obvious that this is a place of work? Perhaps you need more visible reminders of your daily goals, such as a simplified version of your visualization board.

In this critical phase, while still adapting to Dubai, make your desired habits obvious. Tie them to clear visual cues. Place your work planner visibly on your desk every morning to signal it's time for deep work. Schedule blocks of time when your girlfriend knows you are not to be disturbed, making your work hours apparent and respected. These cues will not only help you feel more settled but will also build a system conducive to the focused, pioneering tech entrepreneur you aspire to be.
- Museum curators have been known to discern the difference between an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit even though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off. Just like my own experiences as a tech entrepreneur, where I must often decide between viable AI models or business strategies based on subtle indicators that suggest one might be more successful than another.

- Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area where a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the untrained eye. Similarly, my background in algorithmic trading has trained me to recognize market patterns and anomalies that are not evident to the uninitiated.

- I’ve heard stories, akin to hairdressers noticing a client is pregnant based solely on the feel of her hair, that remind me of how I fine-tune algorithms in deep learning. I can often detect impending failures or successes in model performances not just through metrics, but by sensing nuances in the data processing flow.

- The human brain is a prediction machine. It continuously processes surroundings and analyzes incoming information. In my daily routine, whether coding or creating content, I've honed the ability to predict which tasks will yield the most benefit to my productivity and professional growth. This skill directs my focus effectively, maximizing the use of limited time and resources.

- With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. As I’ve ventured into the depths of AI, each project has subtly sharpened my intuition, enabling me to preemptively adjust strategies, much like how I adjust my daily schedule to optimize for energy and focus, anticipating the needs of my body and mind.

- We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without thinking. Just as I don’t need to remind myself to engage in deep learning or problem-solving - the cornerstones of my professional identity - I’ve structured my environment to naturally steer me towards these activities, turning professional growth into a seamless aspect of my daily existence.

- Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time to eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body has a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time to eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you. Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulating through your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not quite sure what tipped you off.

- This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to it. This is what makes habits useful.

- It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind. You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless someone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth with your hand whenever you laugh, or that you apologize before asking a question. Just as you could find yourself repeatedly checking emails or social media during your work hours without conscious thought, simply because your phone is right next to your laptop as you work on AI algorithms.

- I once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift cards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day, the clerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with gift cards. When the next person walked up, the clerk swiped the customer’s actual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in half—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the stunned customer and realizing what had just happened.

- Another stunning scenario akin to your own experiences, perhaps, involves when you relocate from Amsterdam to Dubai, which involves establishing new routines and habits. Even with such a significant change, you might find that your old habit of beginning your mornings by reviewing your visualization board is momentarily forgotten and replaced by the urgency to settle into the new environment, much like how the preschool teacher-turned-corporate worker kept reverting to her habits of interacting with young children when engaging with her adult colleagues. This illustrates how deeply ingrained and automatic habits can be, showing the importance of consciously adapting and reinforcing new cues in your new setting.
- Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that they are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the remote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that to effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostly nonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.”

### THE HABITS SCORECARD

- The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice that the conductors have a peculiar habit.

- As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions. Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed at, and named aloud.

This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York adopts a similar process. Drawing from this, imagine personalizing a pointing-and-calling system for your daily routine. As you prepare for your deep work sessions in AI, you could point to your closed door, saying "Work mode: no interruptions". Similarly, when preparing to produce content, you might point to your camera and articulate, "Record now", ensuring your focus remains uninterrupted by social media scrolling. This method not only increases awareness of what influences your habits but can significantly decrease chances of deviation or error, aligning perfectly with your entrepreneurial ambitions and productivity goals.
Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level. Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes wrong.

Similarly, the tactic of Pointing-and-Calling can apply to your structured morning routine in Dubai as you strive to wake up at 5 am daily. Instead of waking up in a haze, you could loudly articulate each step as you perform it. “I am turning off my alarm. I am stepping out of bed. I am going to the kitchen to make my oatmeal.” This method can help maintain your focus on the present, reducing the chance of automatic behavior leading you back to sleep or distractions.

The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely attributable to a lack of self-awareness.

One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a systematic approach to bring our most automatic behaviors back into our conscious awareness, like the implementation of a routine audit or review.


## Here’s a sample of where your list might start:

- Wake up
- Turn off alarm
- Resist checking my phone until 1 PM
- Drink a glass of water
- Weigh myself
- Stretch for 5 minutes
- Prepare oatmeal with nuts and berries
- Review my visualization/affirmation board
- Take a shower
- Brush my teeth
- Do 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation

Once you have a full list, look at each behavior and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “—”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.

### For example, your morning routine might look like this

- Wake up +
- Turn off alarm +
- Resist checking my phone until 1 PM +
- Drink a glass of water +
- Weigh myself +
- Stretch for 5 minutes +
- Prepare oatmeal with nuts and berries +
- Review my visualization/affirmation board +
- Take a shower +
- Brush my teeth +
- Do 15 minutes of mindfulness meditation +

Through this exercise, you begin to build a structure that brings intention to each morning, aligning your habits with the goal of becoming a healthier, more focused tech entrepreneur with clear boundaries and priorities.
- Put on deodorant +
- Hang up towel to dry =
- Get dressed =
- Make a cup of tea +

The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your situation and your goals. For someone who is trying to optimize their health and performance as a tech entrepreneur, eating a nutritious breakfast like oatmeal with nuts and berries might be a good habit. For someone else, it might be irrelevant. It all depends on what you’re working toward.

Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as well. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate. There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits. That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For example, your occasional snack that breaks your eating schedule serves you by providing immediate comfort or a mental break, yet it conflicts with your goal of optimized, scheduled nutrition.

- May reduce stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy long-term behavior.

- If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote for or against my desired identity?”

- Habits that reinforce your desired identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired identity are usually bad.

Take checking social media, for instance. While it serves the immediate purpose of connection or relaxation, frequent checks conflict with your desire to minimize distractions and focus deeply on your AI projects. Each habit should be evaluated through the lens of your ultimate aspirations — being a leading tech entrepreneur and a content creator.

- As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on. Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for your successes.

- If you find yourself reaching for a snack, acknowledge it, almost as if you were observing another person. Think, “Oh, how interesting that I would choose this at a time when I'm trying to eat at scheduled times.” If you catch yourself losing an hour on social media, simply note that you are spending more time than intended, which detracts from your goal to produce actively and engage meaningfully on these platforms.

- The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for them. If you're trying to cut back on your snack habit but find yourself reaching for a snack despite a full meal, say out loud, "I’m about to eat this snack, but I don't need it. Eating it will disrupt my healthy eating schedule and impact my performance and health negatively."

- Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful even if you’re simply trying to stay consistent with your social media content schedule. Just saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I will dedicate the first hour of my workday to creating AI content for Twitter," increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re acknowledging the need for action—and that can make all the difference.

- The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the cues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way that benefits you.

# The Best Way to Start a New Habit

In 2001, researchers in Great Britain began working with 248 people to build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The subjects were divided into three groups:

1. The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to track how often they exercised.
   
2. The second group was the "motivation" group. They were asked not only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the benefits of exercise.

3. You, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur working from home with fluctuating fitness routines, might reflect on the value of group three where subjects not only tracked their workout but also wrote down their future workouts in specific contexts. In practice, you could plan to integrate workouts into your daily routine with clear intentions. For example, deciding that “I will work out at 7:00 AM in my home gym focusing on strength training right before my deep work session on AI models,” can tie your fitness routine directly into the core structure of your ambitious days, boosting both your physical and professional productivity.
3. Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan for when and where they would exercise over the following week. Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following sentence: "During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE]."

For you, as a busy tech entrepreneur who is adjusting to a new life in Dubai, this might look something like: "During the next week, I will engage in at least 20 minutes of vigorous exercise on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday at 7 AM in the gym downstairs."

In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised at least once per week. Interestingly, the motivational presentation given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on behavior. However, 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per week—more than double the normal rate.

The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand about when and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a particular habit.

The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of dark chocolate, the sound of emails arriving—but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.

### Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:

"When situation X arises, I will perform response Y."

Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact time and date of when you will work on AI algorithms or recording the schedule for your YouTube content creation. They increase the odds that people will stick with habits like deep work sessions without distractions, posting regularly on social media, and achieving a disciplined bedtime routine.

For instance, your implementation intention to minimize distractions while enhancing deep work might look like: "When it’s 8 AM on weekdays, I will start my workday by turning off my phone and working uninterruptedly in my cabinet until 1 PM."

Researchers have even found that such precise planning increases productivity outcomes, much like how voter turnout increases when people plan exactly when and where they will go to vote.
forced to create implementation intentions by answering questions like: 
- “What route are you taking to the co-working space? 
- At what time are you planning to start your deep work session? 
- Which app will block out distractions?”

Other successful strategies might prompt you to set a clear plan for when to answer emails or directions on when and where to schedule routine tasks that often distract from your main AI project work.

The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow through. Too many people try to change their habits without these basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to optimize my morning routine,” or “I will increase my content production,” but we never say when and where these habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time. An implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want to maximize productivity” or “I wish to exercise more effectively” and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.

Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make an improvement.

Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to wait for inspiration to strike. Do I begin my AI coding session today or not? Do I meditate this morning or between work sprints? When the moment of action occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your predetermined plan.

The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:

I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].

- Example: Deep Work on AI. I will begin my deep AI work session at 5:30 a.m. in my home office.
- Meditation. I will meditate for ten minutes at 7:00 a.m. in the living room.
- Exercise. I will exercise for 60 minutes at 6:00 p.m. at the local gym.
- Social Media Content Creation. I will schedule social media content creation for 30 minutes at 1:00 p.m. using a planning tool in my home office.

If you aren’t implementing these specific intentions into your day, it's easy for preferred behaviors to slip through the cracks in your schedule. By defining the when and where, you take control and avoid leaving important tasks to whim or fading willpower.
**HERE IS THE PART OF THE BOOK IN THE MARKDOWN FORMAT:**

Sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the week, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those times because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.

There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.

Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition, you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never going to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dog salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day you normally work out.”

There are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life and work. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford professor BJ Fogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.

**HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR HABITS**

The French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in poverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.

Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford to pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well known for his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles, her heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s library for the substantial sum of 1000 livres, which not only allowed him to provide for his daughter’s wedding but also to live the rest of his life in financial security.

For someone like yourself, deeply engaged in the tech world and aspiring to enhance AI applications while bettering yourself daily, this concept of habit stacking can be particularly transformative. Consider your goal to integrate regular deep work sessions without interruptions. A strategic approach might be to stack your new desired habit of focused work on top of an existing one - such as the morning routine you already have in place. By creating a sequence – waking up at 5 am, then immediately starting with a planned deep work session from 5:30 am - you can create a robust structure that starts your day on a highly productive note. Just as Diderot experienced a pivotal change through an opportunity, you can leverage habit stacking to catalyze significant changes in your routine that reinforce your professional goals and personal development like never before.
- Diderot acquired a scarlet robe for himself.
- Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe and the rest of his stuff.
- Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel, and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.
- Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
- You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy new high-tech equipment for your AI projects, which then makes your old software seem outdated, prompting upgrades to more sophisticated AI tools. Suddenly, your simple home office setup is transforming into a tech-heavy command center.
- Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to do next based on what you have just finished doing. Setting up a new AI model leads to tweaking algorithm parameters, which reminds you to check the latest machine learning research, then you find yourself updating your YouTube content to reflect these insights.
- Why is this important?
- When it comes to building new habits, you can use the connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to build a new ha
### Habit Stacking

- Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention. Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location, you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an obvious cue for nearly any habit.

- ### The habit stacking formula is
  “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

### For example

- **Deep Work**: After I close the door of my cabinet in the morning, I will start with 30 minutes of uninterrupted deep work on my AI project.
- **Learning**: After I finish my deep work session, I will spend 20 minutes studying the latest AI research or practicing a new coding technique.
- **Content Creation**: After I eat lunch, I will spend the first 15 minutes recording or outlining content for my YouTube channel on AI tools.
- **Personal Wellness**: After I turn off my work computer at the end of the day, I will do a 15-minute stretching routine to transition from work to personal time.
- **Connection**: After dinner with Anastasiia, I will spend 10 minutes responding to personal messages or connecting with my family online.

The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the Diderot Effect.

**HABIT STACKING**

### CUE CRAVING RESPONSE REWARD

- FIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue for the next.

### Your morning routine habit stack might look like this

1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will review my visualisation/affirmation board for five minutes to set my intentions for the day.
2. After I review my board, I will meditate for sixty seconds to clear my mind and enhance focus.
3. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for the day, focusing on prioritizing high-impact AI and business development tasks.
4. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin my first deep work block, tackling the most challenging task while my cognitive resources are at their peak.
### Or, consider this habit stack in the evening

After I finish using my programming tools, I will write a brief summary of what I accomplished and what needs to be tackled next. This helps in ensuring a flowing transition in my work for the AI projects.

After writing down my daily accomplishments, I will spend a few minutes planning the content for my next YouTube video concerning AI tools and real-world applications. This aligns with my goal to build my personal brand and share useful knowledge.

After planning my YouTube content, I will tidy up my workspace in my home office. A clear space supports a clear mind, allowing for deeper focus during my deep work sessions the next morning.

Additionally, as you already have a morning routine focused on high-priority tasks, you could integrate more personal development or wellness habits to your evening routine:
Wake up > Start with AI Project > At lunch, revise your visualization/affirmation board > Post-lunch, dedicate time to answer key emails and messages to maintain your business and personal relationships.

Utilize habit stacking to ensure your workspace encourages productivity and personal habits contribute to your well-being. For instance:
- Remembering to stand from your desk and stretch after each hour of work can be paired with reviewing your to-do list to re-focus.
- Incorporating a weekly review of your eating habits and meal prep processes can ensure that your dietary habits align with your health and wellness goals while being efficient and less of a chore.

### N

After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the dishwasher.

After putting my dishes away, I immediately wipe down the counter, setting my environment clean and organized, which reflects and supports my mindset for clarity in all areas of my life.

After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for tomorrow morning along with my daily planner. By doing so, I am prepared to start the day aligned with my goals, especially managing my high-priority tasks with minimal distractions.

These simple habit stacks ensure that your evening routine supports your entrepreneurial and personal objectives by integrating restorative practices with preparatory actions for the next day.

No matter how you adapt this strategy, the key to a satisfying habit stack is selecting a cue that naturally integrates into your existing routines and directly supports your larger goals. Unlike an implementation intention, which specifies the time and location of a behavior, a habit stack weaves into your existing pattern, ensuring continual progress toward your desired state of being a focused and disciplined tech entrepreneur.

Habit stacking implicitly has the time and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit into your daily routine can make a big difference. For example, if you're trying to add a quick morning review of your visualization/affirmation board to your routine but find mornings chaotic due to early work schedules, then that time might not be best. Instead, consider when you are most likely to be uninterrupted and can give your full attention. Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit. If you want to engage with your affirmation board every day, but you stack it on top of something like a weekly office meeting, that’s not going to reinforce the habit daily.

One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use the Habits Scorecard as a starting point. Alternatively, you can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the habits you do each day without fail.

- Wake up at 5:00 AM.
- Drink coffee while checking emails.
- Begin deep work on AI projects.
- Post daily content on Twitter and YouTube.
- Eat lunch.
- Meditate or stretch post-lunch.
- Finish the workday.
- Evening walk with Anastasiia.
- Dinner and downtime.
- Review goals and plan the next day.
- Read or relax in bed before sleep.
- Go to bed at 8:30 PM.

Your list will be unique, but you get the idea. In the second column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day without fail.

- Your alarm clock rings.
- New notifications appear on your phone.
- Regular meal times.
- Sunset from your apartment window.

Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.

Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. For instance, when you wanted to ensure consistent wake times, initially deciding to "wake early and go to bed early" was too broad without specific times. A more specific stack could be: “When my alarm goes off at 5:00 AM, I will stand up from the bed, drink a glass of water, and immediately review my affirmation board. This routine ensures precise bookends to your day, encouraging consistency.” This approach leverages the specificity needed for habit stacking, intertwining new habits with established cues for effective integration into your daily life.
## Chapter Summary

- The 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it obvious.
- The two most common cues are time and location.
- Creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location.
- The implementation intention formula is: I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
- Habit stacking is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a current habit.
- The habit stacking formula is: After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].

For instance, considering your goal to wake up at 5 am every day, you can use an implementation intention such as, "I will wake up at 5 am in my bedroom," setting multiple alarms around your room to make this obvious and unavoidable. Similarly, habit stacking can play a significant role in your morning routine. After shutting off your alarm (current habit), you might stack a new habit like "I will then spend five minutes reviewing my affirmation/visualization board" to integrate your personal development goals seamlessly into your morning.

- **Motivation Is Overrated; Environment Often Matters More**

In *The Power of Habit*, a primary care physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she didn’t plan on talking to them at all.

Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. They started by changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria prominently displayed sodas. By simply rearranging these refrigerators to showcase water bottles at the prominent eye-level shelves and moving sodas to lower shelves, they significantly increased the sale of water bottles and reduced the sale of sodas without any explicit motivational initiative from the hospital staff.

Now, to apply this to your life, especially regarding your diet and propensity for snacking, consider redesigning your kitchen environment. Place healthier snacks like nuts, fruits, and yogurt at eye level in your refrigerator or on your countertops, and store less healthy snacks like chips or cookies out of immediate sight, perhaps in a high cupboard or back corner. This environmental shift can make it easier for you to grab a healthy snack without thinking, thus aligning with your goal of eating cleaner and maintaining energy throughout your demanding workdays.

By using these principles to mold the environments of both your home office and kitchen, your day-to-day actions can become more automated in favor of your long-term business and personal health goals. This requires minimal motivation and willpower as your environment itself guides your habits, proving the importance of a well-structured physical workspace and living area in fostering optimal habits for success and well-being.
**BEFORE**

**AFTER**

# Entrance Entrance

**FIGURE 8:** Here is a representation of what the cafeteria looked like before the environment design changes were made (left) and after (right). The shaded boxes indicate areas where bottled water was available in each instance. Because the amount of water in the environment was increased, behavior shifted naturally and without additional motivation.

- People often choose products not because of what they are, but because of where they are. If I walk into my home office and see my phone on the desk, I'll unconsciously pick it up and start browsing social media, even if I hadn't been thinking about it beforehand and didn't necessarily need to check it. If the first thing I see in the morning is my laptop open to my coding environment, it's going to be much easier to start working on my AI projects. Our habits change depending on the room we are in and the cues in front of us.

- Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior. Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again and again under certain environmental conditions. In my home office, I can foster a state of deep work by organizing my desk without distractions; no smartphone within sight, just my computer, relevant books, and a notepad. On the other hand, in my living room, I'm more likely to relax and discuss plans with Anastasiia or just enjoy some downtime. In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is context-dependent.

- In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful assertion: behavior is a function of the person in their environment (B = f(P, E)). Even after relocating to Dubai, adjusting to a new environment can be made smoother by arranging physical spaces that align with my goals. For example, setting up a specific, inviting reading corner that beckons me to engage in my daily reading habit adds a strong visual cue that can help reinforce this desired behavior without requiring additional motivation each day. Similarly, having my workout gear laid out the night before in a designated spot reduces barriers and simplifies the decision to engage in regular physical activity, supporting my goal to maintain a consistent fitness routine.
### The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

- It didn't take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business, and the insights hold valuable lessons for your entrepreneurial journey in the tech and AI field. In 1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” For example, when developing AI solutions, by presenting the product prominently within tech communities or explained effectively in your YouTube content, you can create immediate perceived value or need among potential users.

- For instance, consider how you arrange your workspace in your home office. Just as items at eye level on store shelves are more likely to be purchased, tools and resources for your AI projects should be the most accessible in your environment. This principle leverages human tendencies toward convenience and immediacy, critical when you are balancing numerous tasks daily. This could mean placing your most frequently used AI literature and coding notebooks on your desk rather than let them be buried under other paperwork.

- The principle of making things obvious goes beyond physical space and into digital domains. For example, if your role requires you to engage heavily on social media platforms for brand building, consider making these tasks as frictionless as possible. Keep tools like content calendars or digital templates readily accessible on your computer desktop. Remember, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically from end-of-the-aisle racks. Similarly, strategically placing your necessary work apps on your computer or scheduling specific 'content creation blocks' can enhance productivity.

- The ubiquity and accessibility of a product or service significantly influence choices, just as the availability of Bud Light in every bar helps maintain its popularity. In your case, having an organised, distraction-free digital workspace where tools like code editors, data analysis software, and other development tools are readily accessible can expedite your work processes, making it easier for you to stay on task.

- Just as different animals use their unique perceptions to navigate the environment, you must use your skilled perception shaped by years belonging to high-performing academic and professional environments in math and tech. This finely tuned perception enables you to identify patterns, opportunities, and efficiencies that less trained eyes might miss, essential when creating innovative AI solutions or compelling digital content.

- Your perception, directed by years of intense focus and specialized education, can be compared to these natural instincts. By consciously arranging physical and digital spaces to support your entrepreneurial activities, you keep essential tasks glaringly evident and your day-to-day actions aligned with your long-term goals of being a leading tech entrepreneur and an influential content creator in the AI space.
# Designing Your Environment for Success

During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch researchers began to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage. In one suburb near Amsterdam—a city you are familiar with, having lived there for two years—they found that some homeowners used 30 percent less energy than their neighbors—despite the homes being of similar size and getting electricity for the same price.

It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical except for one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had one in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the main hallway. As you may guess, from your own experience of living in different environments, the homes with the meters located in the main hallway used less electricity. This relates closely to your current situation in Dubai, where designing your environment to reduce distractions and increase productivity in your home office could influence your success significantly. Location and visibility of tools can motivate or dissuade action, much like placing your gym equipment in sight to maintain regular workout habits or having visual cues such as your affirmation board prominently displayed to reinforce daily review and motivation.

When your energy use—or in your case, the use of time and focus for AI projects—is obvious and easy to track, like with visible signs or designated spaces for specific activities, you naturally become more efficient and intentional. For example, if you set a specific workstation solely for deep work, free from personal distractions, it helps in maintaining that crucial focus needed for developing AI solutions, thus leveraging environmental cues effectively. This principle applies even to smaller tasks; arranging your daily tools and resources in a way that makes them easily accessible can drastically cut down on the procrastination and time wasted on decision-making. The environment shapes behavior, and small changes in the organization of your space can lead to significant enhancements in productivity and personal satisfaction.
Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live and work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is no obvious cue to trigger the behavior.

- Creating obvious visual cues can draw your attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked like a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men stepped up to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.

I’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. For example, when I started leaving my gym bag packed and visible in my home office space in Dubai, I noticed a significant increase in my motivation to hit my daily workouts, no matter if I was busy with AI projects or not.
  
Similarly, you can leverage the principles of obvious cues to optimize your environment for productivity and focus, especially as an aspiring tech entrepreneur working from home. Consider placing your affirmation board in a conspicuous spot in your office, perhaps right across from your desk where you can't miss seeing it every day as you begin your work. This would serve as a cue not only to reinforce your daily visualization practice but also to instill the mindset needed for high productivity throughout the day.

Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:

- If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have multiple cues. For instance, as someone who values early mornings, placing an analog alarm clock across the room could be an effective cue to get up at 5 am, making it necessary to get out of bed to turn it off.

- The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that you’ll think about your habits regularly. Placing a water bottle next to your workstation can remind you to stay hydrated, setting a timer for breaks can cue stretching or quick physical activities, energizing you for high-focus sessions. These simple cues can profoundly influence the seamless integration of healthy habits into your daily life, enhancing both personal and professional satisfaction.
### THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE

For example, many entrepreneurs, much like yourself, find themselves more distracted or less productive in certain settings—this isn't just about personal weaknesses but about the environment cultivated either consciously or unconsciously. Consider your own experiences: perhaps you find yourself checking social media more often when working in less structured environments or during specific times of the day when energy dips occur.

- Observing your own habits in different areas of your living space can be enlightening. In your dedicated cabinet at home, are you more productive than when sitting in the living room? These spaces are not merely physical locations but interact with your psychological states.

- You mentioned that routine tasks and distractions affect your focus, especially when you work from home. Link specific habits to particular locales within your apartment. Establish your cabinet not just as a place of general work but as the zone for deep, uninterrupted AI project work. Make the living room a designated break area where checking social media is acceptable, thereby placing a psychological barrier against distractions in your working space.

- Consider how rearranging even minor elements can refocus your actions. Perhaps placing your affirmation board in a prominent place so you see it immediately when you enter your work zone could serve as an impactful cue to align your daily activities with your long-term aspirations.

- Reflecting on your move from Amsterdam to Dubai, recognize this as an opportunity. New environments can disrupt old cues that trigger unproductive habits. Now is the ideal time to establish new, better habits tied to your new surroundings.

- Lastly, consider the broader, virtual environments you engage with. For instance, if social media platforms are sources of distraction, can you modify your digital environment to reduce exposure to those triggers? Use technology to your advantage—schedule app limits or create a work-specific user profile on your devices where distractions like social notifications are systematically disabled during work hours.

By thinking of your environment in terms of relationships rather than just physical or digital spaces, you can more effectively harness the power of context to foster habits that support your aspirations as an AI entrepreneur and content creator. Like the tech algorithms you develop, consider your daily habits and spaces as programmable elements designed to optimize your productivity and well-being.
- Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your current thought patterns.

When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very difficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end of work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table my office or the space where I ate meals?

A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that happened “in here” and personal life was something that happened “out there.”

Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness. You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check email, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a mishmash of cues.

You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in Dubai now, and while my apartment is spacious, my home office doubles as a guest room.” Fair enough. If your space must serve dual functions, designate specific areas for specific activities: your desk is strictly for deep work on AI projects or content creation for your YouTube channel, a corner with a small table could be for reading and personal development, and another corner can be equipped for virtual meetings or discussions with your girlfriend Anastasiia to delineate clear work-life boundaries. You can apply the same concept to your digital spaces. For instance, dedicate one browser or computer user profile entirely for your professional development, content creation, and AI research, while another can be for personal use and social media, which you restrict to certain times of the day to minimize distractions.
, his tablet only for reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit should have a home.

If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits thrive under predictable circumstances like these. For instance, by designating your cabinet as a space purely for deep work on your AI projects, focus will come more naturally without the distractions that home life might bring. Similarly, making your living room a relaxation-only zone can help signal to your mind that it’s time to unwind, helping with recovery and stress management. If you’re aiming for stable behavioral outcomes like consistent bedtime or uninterrupted work hours, establishing a predictable environment is key.

## Chapter Summary

### The Secret to Self-Control

1. As the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year, congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy from Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American public. While visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S. soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had tried heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was even worse than they had initially thought.

   The discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including the creation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under President Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track addicted service members when they returned home.

   Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home, only 5 percent of them became readdicted within a year, and just 12 percent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated their addiction nearly overnight.

   This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which considered h
eroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible condition. Instead, Robins found that in Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by cues triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by the constant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers who were also heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home. Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found himself in an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context changed, so did the habit.

Similarly, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur who has recently moved from Amsterdam to Dubai, you're in a new environment, a scenario that can potentially disrupt old habits while creating new ones. The relocation provides a unique opportunity to establish new routines without the old cues that might have led to productivity lapses or unnecessary stress in Amsterdam. Use this change of scenery to build a workspace free from distractions, aligning closely with your goal to minimize social media interactions until post-noon. This new environment can naturally foster the habits you want to form without requiring excessive self-discipline.

- which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their habit—then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It’s no wonder that usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become readdicted once they return home from rehab.
  
For you, maintaining the clarity and simplicity you crave will follow a similar logic. Like the returning soldiers, falling back into old routines can be easy when familiar triggers are around. To support your new habits, whether they're waking up at 5 am, focusing deeply on AI development, or maintaining consistent workout schedules, consider refining your environment continually to support these ambitions. Rearrange your new home office in a way that reinforces your work-life boundaries with Anastasiia, perhaps by having a physical "do not disturb" signal when deep in work.

- The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs about bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of unhealthy behavior. Recent research, however, shows something different. When scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control, it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who are struggling. Instead, in other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.
  
Similarly, reducing your exposure to social media can aid in managing its addictive nature. By structurally limiting access to these platforms to specific times of the day, you're creating a less tempting environment, making it easier to maintain focus on AI development and content creation. This aligns with your goal of minimal distractions, fostering an environment where deep work is natural, not a struggle.

- The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it very often. This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you understand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the relevant situation arises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin, Texas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horses with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it for years. She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horse 

Drawing parallels to Patty’s experience, consider your struggled habits like viewing social media. By associating specific actions, such as only checking social media after publishing content, you encode habits that are triggered by productive behavior rather than time-fillers. As Patty avoided horses to kick a smoking habit, consider pairing specific productive actions as cues for your less productive temptations. This deliberate structuring makes indulging in distractions a reward for productivity instead of a habitual time-waster, leveraging your environment and natural human tendencies toward habit formation to bolster your entrepreneurial and personal development goals.
again and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever. The cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them in a long time.

- Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change techniques can backfire. For instance, in your case, constant exposure to tech tools and platforms while managing your business and social media content can trigger involuntary checks on emails or Twitter, thereby acting as cues. The exposure in a digital workspace can induce the checking habits even more, pushing you toward potential distractions that hamper productivity.

- Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the feelings they try to numb. You might feel overwhelmed by unresolved tasks or distracted by the chaos of notifications; as a result, you might turn to social media for a mental break. This only further compounds the feeling of being overwhelmed and unproductive, leading to a cycle where the easy escape of engaging with distracting content keeps pulling you back. For instance, the cue of receiving a notification can drive the behavior of checking social media, which momentarily reduces stress but soon leaves you feeling more drained, thereby wanting another "break" and perpetuating the cycle.

Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit. Once you notice something, you begin to want it. This process is happening all the time—often without us realizing it. Scientists have found that showing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three milliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain and sparks desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously register—the addicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved the drug all the same. Simultaneously, in your scenario, even a brief glance at your phone or an unexpected notification can trigger a cascade of unintended app checking and scrolling, gripping you in a digital distraction loop without full awareness of the initial cue.

Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely. Just like in programming, where refactoring old code can often be more challenging than writing new functionality, reshaping old habits requires significant and consistent effort to override the deeply embedded patterns of past behavior.

## Chapter Summary

### HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT

Let's employ the strategies of Atomic Habits to your specific lifestyle and aspirations as an aspiring tech entrepreneur and content creator:

- **Make It Obvious**: If you wish to establish a habit of waking up at 5 am, place your alarm clock (or phone if you use it as an alarm) in your home office. This forces you to leave the bedroom and minimizes the temptation to snooze, making your wake-up routine more deliberate. Remember, the environment that cues your habits is crucial. Make your workspace free of distractions like cell phones and social media notifications during core work hours, supporting your goal for deep work focus.

- **Make It Attractive**: To make your goal of daily AI expertise growth and content production more attractive, integrate elements that you enjoy. For instance, balance deep technical sessions with more creative content creation or discussions with other AI experts. This variety not only enhances attractiveness but also reinforces your identity as an engaged, dynamic tech entrepreneur. Remember how you tied listening to fantasy audiobooks with gym workouts? Apply similar incentives here, such as allowing a favorite podcast only while engaging in routine task-solving or minor life improvements.

- **Make It Easy**: Simplify the process of engaging in less appealing yet important tasks (like responding to messages or managing routine but essential operations). Dedicate a specific, limited time slot for these activities, perhaps using a timer to signal when to start and when to stop. This "time boxing" reduces the mental burden of having a potentially endless task, making it easier to handle it daily. By packaging this time as a non-negotiable part of your day, similar to how you pack your gym bag the day before, you reduce friction and make consistency more achievable.

- **Make It Satisfying**: Immediate satisfaction in your habits is crucial. After completing your dedicated AI work session, have a clear, enjoyable reward waiting — something simple like a high-quality coffee break or a short session in the sauna. This reinforces satisfaction, making it more likely for the habit to stick. Feedback loops are your ally; share your daily progress on social media not just as content, but as a motivator through community support and accountability.

By tailoring these principles directly to your context, you develop a framework that not only supports achieving your goals but makes the journey towards them engaging and aligned with your ultimate vision of life. This personalized approach ensures that your habits deeply integrate into your lifestyle and aspirations, making the process of becoming a legendary entrepreneur intuitive and natural.
### HOW TO BREAK A BAD HABIT

- **Inversion of the 1st Law** - Make It Invisible
  - Reduce exposure, Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.
  
  As you're trying to combat social media addiction, consider rearranging the apps on your phone or using tools to block these sites during work hours. By making social media invisible during these times, the cue to check updates or messages is removed, making it easier to stay focused on your AI projects.

- **Inversion of the 2nd Law** - Make It Difficult

  To further help with your social media habit, you can also add more steps to access these apps. For example, logging out after each use requires you to manually enter your password every time. This added step makes it more difficult and gives you a moment to consider if you really need to log on.

- **Inversion of the 3rd Law** - Make It Unsatisfying
  
  Public accountability can play a crucial role here. Inform your accountability group about your goal to reduce social media usage. Their support and the potential of public 'failure' can make the habit of reaching for your phone less appealing, as you’re now accountable not just to yourself but to your peers.

- **Inversion of the 4th Law** - Make It Unsatisfying

  Establish immediate negative consequences for indulging in bad habits. If you catch yourself using social media during your designated deep work hours, commit to a penalty that benefits your goals, like an extra hour of deep learning study or content creation. This transforms the immediate gratification of distraction into an unsatisfying experience, reinforcing your motivation to stay focused.

# THE 2ND LAW

Make It Attractive

## How to Make a Habit Irresistible

In your quest to transition from tech enthusiast to AI thought leader, consider your environment filled with AI projects, industry news, and interaction with other experts. The allure of engaging deeply in your field becomes like the red spot used by Niko Tinbergen in his experiments. Each piece of groundbreaking AI research or a successful project outcome can act as that 'red spot', compelling and motivating you to delve further.

- For instance, surrounding yourself with ongoing projects and frequent discussions about AI in your home office or during meetups makes engaging with AI irresistibly attractive. Just like the herring gulls, align your environment with cues that enhance your excitement and engagement with AI—set your desktop background to topics you're studying, place relevant books within sight, and have your research tools readily available.

By understanding these principles and personalizing strategies around your lifestyle, you can create a habitat of productivity and innovation that continuously draws you toward your goals—an environment where good habits are not only easier to form but also irresistibly engaging.
- Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The bigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made a tremendous effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the

- Greylag goose was following an instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try to get it.

- Like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.

- Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah. When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival. 
- Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their evolutionary purpose. 
- A primary goal of food science is to create products that are more attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has been enhanced in some way, if only with additional flavoring. Companies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying level of crunch i

In your journey, think of AI tools and social media like junk food in this analogy—seemingly beneficial for your growth and sustenance in the short term but potentially dangerous if they begin to consume too much of your focus and time. Just as the food industry enhances products to increase consumption, social media platforms engineer their content to maximize engagement, capitalizing on the same reward circuits. However, just as you choose clean eating by prioritizing steak, eggs, and greens over sugary, processed foods, you can similarly manage your digital consumption. By setting clear boundaries for social media use, like turning off your phone or using apps only after accomplishing critical daily goals in your AI development or content creation, you cultivate healthier digital habits that align with your identity as a focused, innovative tech entrepreneur.
In the maze of tech entrepreneurship and AI, the bright, engaging pop-ups on your social media are akin to the fizz in a soda or that perfect crunch of a potato chip. Entire industries, much like the food scientists strive for the 'bliss point' in products, are designed to capture and hold your attention. This digital 'bliss point' - whether it’s a well-timed notification or a particularly engaging tweet - keeps pulling you back, turning a simple task like posting about AI into minutes (or even hours) of scrolling. The hyperpalatable experience of these digital interactions is hard to resist because they’ve been fine-tuned to push the psychological buttons that control habit loops.

Visualize this: your home office setup in Dubai. Close by in the living room, your girlfriend, Anastasiia, might be watching something captivating on TV. The sounds and flickers are like the dynamic contrast in food - the crispy, crunchy outside of a fries paralleling a lively discussion thread on Twitter that tempts you away from your focused AI project space. These distractions offer a mix of sensory experiences that keep pulling your attention, breaking the consistency needed for deep work.

Given your aspirations and environment, it’s crucial to recognize these ‘foods’ in your digital and physical workspace. Like the food industries seeking the perfect 'bliss point', your tech-savvy background can help in automating or setting physical and application-based barriers against these distractions. Harness your programming skills to tailor-make applications that limit your access to distracting sites at critical work hours, or physically rearrange your home office to reduce visibility and audibility of distractions. 

In essence, every tweet, every audible TV program nearby is a test of your will in much the same way every bite of hyperpalatable food tries the resilience of a diet. With your goals of a disciplined life, identifying and modifying or even eliminating these digital and environmental 'flavors' that derail productivity is as crucial as choosing kale over pizza when aiming for nutritional health. Your personal bliss point needs to be one that aligns with achieving your vision of becoming a legendary tech maestro, where distractions are managed, not indulged.
If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become more concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a more concentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature, these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. Just as in your life, you've noticed how easily distractions like social media can pull you away from deep work, offering immediate enjoyment but jeopardizing long-term goals like your AI projects. You have the brains of a tech-savvy entrepreneur but challenges they never had to face.

If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you need to make it attractive.

Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring a neurotransmitter called dopamine. The importance of dopamine became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn't eat. They wouldn't have sex. They didn't crave anything. Within a few days, the animals died of thirst.

In your daily routine, consider this dopamine-driven mechanism whenever you find yourself automatically reaching for a mid-morning snack despite not being hungry. Your brain is likely seeking a dopamine hit rather than actual sustenance, reflecting a craving conditioned by habit rather than a real physiological need. 

In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as before; they just didn't want it anymore.

Apply this to your own experiences. Being knowledgeable in AI, you've undoubtedly enjoyed the process of coding and problem-solving throughout your academic and professional career. This intrinsic satisfaction can be likened to the rats' enjoyment of the sugar—it's not always about wanting or craving to solve a programming problem, but when engaged, you appreciate and derive pleasure from the activity.

When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of dopamine each time they poked their nose into a hole, leading to frantic, repeated behavior. This phenomenon can mirror the urge you might feel to check updates on social media platforms, where notifications and new content continuously promise and often deliver quick dopamine spikes, keeping you hooked.

By recognizing these patterns and the neuroscience behind them, you can start to re-engineer your daily schedule and environment in Dubai to minimize triggers associated with unproductive or distracting habits. This insight will be crucial as you strive to refine your work-life boundaries and enhance your entrepreneurial endeavors.

Remember, to make substantive, positive changes aligned with your aspirations, it’s essential to condition your environment and daily behaviors so that the most attractive options are also the ones that propel you towards your goals. This involves not only avoiding the dopamine-driven pitfalls of modern digital life but also strategically creating and positioning rewarding experiences that support your larger objectives.
- Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before they place a bet, not after they win. Similarly, as a tech entrepreneur, your dopamine might spike when you brainstorm or ideate new AI solutions or potential business models, not necessarily after their successful execution. Your anticipation to create and innovate is what continually drives you to action.

- Cocaine addicts get a surge of dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. In your case, the prospect of achieving ground-breaking results in AI or gaining new followers from posting insightful content might boost your dopamine levels, fueling your motivation.

- Whenever you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of dopamine spike in anticipation. And when dopamine rises, so does your motivation to act. If we consider your daily routine - beginning early with important AI projects or content creation - your anticipation of a productive day could be what pushes you out of bed at 5 AM. Here, the cue might be the morning itself, acting as a reminder of the rewarding sense of accomplishment that follows a day of significant progress.

- Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you anticipate a reward. This explains why the planning and anticipation of your business tasks or creating YouTube content might often seem more satisfying than executing mundane tasks like managing routine chores or replying to messages.

- THE DOPAMINE SPIKE:
    - FIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the reward is experienced for the first time. 
    - For you, the first time you successfully applied an AI solution to a real-world problem, dopamine was released, reinforcing the activity. 
    - The next time around (B), dopamine rises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. Your morning routine acts as a cue setting this mechanism in motion.  
    - Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is experienced because you already expect the reward. 
    - However, if you see a cue and expect a reward but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in disappointment (C). An example is expecting a breakthrough with an AI project but facing unexpected hurdles instead.
    - The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly be seen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified, and dopamine rises as a craving builds. Perhaps, taking longer than expected to edit a high-quality video may lead to this fluctuating dopamine response.
    - Finally, when the reward comes a little later than you had hoped, dopamine spikes again - a powerful reinforcement when your content eventually gets more engagement than expected or when a challenging AI solution finally works as desired. It is as if the brain is saying, "See! I knew I was right. Don't forget to repeat this action next time."

Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting rewards (developing AI solutions, creating influential content) than for liking them (routine tasks). The distinction between wanting and liking is vital in understanding motivational dynamics in high-stake environments like yours.
### HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS MORE ATTRACTIVE

Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland, enjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise more often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne hacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and television. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, “eliminating obesity one Netflix binge at a time.”

This concept of temptation bundling can be particularly useful for you as an aspiring tech entrepreneur who aims to integrate deep work and personal wellness effectively into a daily routine. Imagine using a similar setup where you could only listen to your favorite AI podcasts or audiobooks while engaging in a workout. This strategy merges your passion for learning with your commitment to physical health.

You could also apply this to your social media habits. Since your goal is to minimize distractions and maximize productive output, you could create a system where access to social media platforms like Twitter or Instagram is allowed only after you've completed a deep work session or finished producing content for your YouTube channel about AI. This links the pleasure of browsing through social media with the completion of significant work, making the work itself more attractive due to the reward that follows.

Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when the American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC, launched its Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014-2015 season, they promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale.

Every Thursday, the company would air three shows created by screenwriter Shonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to Get Away with Murder. They branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT stands for Thank God It’s Thursday).

- In addition to promoting the shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and enjoy the evening.

Utilize a similar approach by designating a "Tech Founder TGIT," where every Thursday evening you allow yourself to enjoy a leisure activity like watching a favorite movie or having a game night with Anastasiia, but only after a productive week where key business tasks and content creation goals are met. This not only makes your leisure time more rewarding but also aligns it with the successful completion of your weekly objectives, making it more appealing to stick to your work schedule.

Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea behind the campaign: “We see Thursday night as a viewership opportunity.

You can see each component of your daily schedule as an opportunity—not only to advance in your professional life but also to enhance personal satisfaction and maintain a balanced lifestyle. By structurally integrating such temptation bundling techniques, you're more likely to find daily routines not only sustainable but also enjoyable, aligning both with your immediate gratification needs and long-term aspirations as a tech entrepreneur and content creator.
unity, with either couples or women by themselves who want to sit down and escape and have fun and drink their red wine and have some popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows) with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine, and eat popcorn).

Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8 p.m. every Thursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means relaxation and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue, and the habit of turning on the television becomes more attractive.

You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one of your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear about the latest artificial intelligence breakthroughs, but you need to get in shape. Using temptation bundling, you could only listen to AI and tech podcasts at the gym. Maybe you want to engage in a session of deep stretching or cryotherapy, but you also need to outline new content for your YouTube channel. Solution: only brainstorm content ideas while engaging in your chosen wellness activity.

Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t really want to brainstorm YouTube content, you’ll become conditioned to do it if it means you get to do something you really enjoy along the way.

You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your behavior.

- If you want to check the latest trends on social media, but you need to maintain deep work focus

- After I complete two hours of uninterrupted deep work on my AI projects, I will check Twitter for ten minutes (need).
- After I check Twitter, I will turn off notifications and return to another session of deep work (want).

### If you want to watch sports, but you need to make significant progress on your business model

- After I finish my daily workout, which is prime thinking time, I will jot down any new business ideas that came to mind during exercise (need).
- After I record these ideas, I can watch a short highlight reel of my favorite sports event (want).
### If you want to check Twitter, but you need to focus on AI problem-solving
- After I sit at my workstation in the morning, I will dedicate uninterrupted 90 minutes to solving a specific AI problem (need).
- After solving the AI problem, I will check Twitter for industry updates (want).

The premise here is that you'll start looking forward to engaging with Twitter because it will be a reward for focusing on complex AI tasks. Doing the task you need to do allows you to enjoy the thing you want to do.

### If you feel tempted to respond to a non-urgent notification, but you need to finalize a YouTube video on AI 
- After I enter my dedicated content creation block, I will finalize editing one section of my AI tutorial (need).
- After completing the editing, I'll spend a few minutes catching up on notifications (want).

Through this approach, the act of content editing, which might feel repetitive or intense at times, is immediately rewarded, making it more enjoyable and potentially more consistent.

## Chapter Summary

- The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits

Imagine the influence and learning curve you could leverage by interacting with a network of AI entrepreneurs, much like Laszlo Polgar intentionally engaged his family in focused chess learning. As you embrace this tightly-knit learning and accountability environment, picture, for instance, participating in regular mastermind calls with other industry innovators, mirroring the Polgar family’s dedication to chess.

Just as Laszlo strategically chose chess for his daughters, you can craft a nurturing environment around your interests in AI and entrepreneurship. This might involve structured brainstorming sessions with colleagues or setting up weekly reviews with your mentor or accountability group to refine your AI projects and personal brand strategy. Each interaction acts not just as a touchpoint for feedback but reinforces your dedication much like regular chess practices honed the Polgar sisters' skills.

By cultivating a similarly deliberate and supportive network, your journey can be both accelerated and aligned more closely with your vision of becoming a legendary tech entrepreneur, surrounded by partners and mentors who are just as committed to the growth of AI applications as you are.
### THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS

Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse, being cast out—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.”

Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.” As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern behavior.

For you, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur deeply engaged in the AI field, integrating into specific, high-level tech communities can be likened to this tribal belonging. Much like the early tribes, your success, particularly in the fast-evolving tech industry, can heavily depend on your social integration with these groups. Participating actively in AI development communities, networking with fellow entrepreneurs on platforms like Twitter, and harnessing the collaborative potential of YouTube as a content-sharing platform enhance not just your personal brand but also your knowledge and innovation capabilities.

Moreover, as you settle in Dubai and adapt to new cultural and social norms, understanding and aligning with these local business ethics and practices can play a crucial role in the success of your business ventures. Just as the Polgar sisters thrived in a culture that prioritized chess, creating an environment in your daily life and work that prioritizes AI and entrepreneurship will make these activities more attractive and instinctual for you.

Your relocation from Amsterdam to Dubai can be seen as an opportunity to embed new social norms and professional habits that align with your goals. The way you adopt new routines and possible collaborations in Dubai is much like how migrants adopt new cultural habits, ensuring survival and success in new settings. By consciously shaping your social and professional environment, you can foster habits that not only align with your professional aspirations but also integrate well with your lifestyle needs and personal well-being.

In summary, just as our ancestors prospered by adhering to tribal norms, your professional journey in AI and entrepreneurship can greatly benefit from deep integration into your chosen communities and the new cultural landscape of Dubai. Building strong networks, understanding the local business environment, and aligning your personal habits with your professional goals are modern equivalents of ancient survival strategies—crucial for your success and contentment in this new chapter.
As habits form, we often imitate them. We follow the script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school, our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when and whether to get married, how many children to have, which holidays to celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s birthday party.

As the French philosopher Michel de Montaigne wrote, "The customs and practices of life in society sweep us along." Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a burden. Everyone wants to belong. For instance, in your case, if you grew up in a family that rewards technical excellence and intellectual achievements, like participating in national math competitions, these activities become attractive. If you find yourself in tech circles where long working hours are the norm, logging early hours and late nights might seem like the right thing to do to fit in.

Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive.

- **Imitating the Close**

Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the physical environment, as discussed earlier, but it is also true of the social environment.

We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another, the way our coworkers get results. When your friends in Dubai might have an active lifestyle, engaging in sports or going to the gym, you are likely to join in. Similarly, if Anastasiia, your girlfriend, has a habit of managing her tasks efficiently or keeping a disciplined eating schedule, these habits might become attractive for you to adopt as well.

I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture of the other person. During your internships and your time in algorithmic trading, you might have picked up specific professional behaviors or technical skills by observing and mimicking successful colleagues. When living in Amsterdam, you might have found yourself adopting some local customs or lifestyle habits, which could change again now that you're settling into Dubai.

As a general rule, look at the environments and communities you are part of: your tech entrepreneur circle, AI communities, workout groups, or even online platforms like Twitter. Noticing the positive habits prevailing in these groups can help you adopt them consciously, making your personal and professional growth more organic and more aligned with your identity as a pioneering tech entrepreneur.
**The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive**

8 **How to Make a Habit Irresistible**

9 **The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping Your Habits**

Consider your current situation, where you've just relocated to Dubai after living in Amsterdam. This environment brings new routines and can potentially influence your habits significantly. In this transition, involve Anastasiia in your journey of forming habits supportive of your entrepreneurial goals. For example, when you decide to work undisturbed on AI projects, communicating the importance of this "focus time" to her makes it a shared understanding. Consequently, this not only builds your habit but subtly encourages her to adopt or respect similar practices, enhancing your mutual productivity and focus.

10 **How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits**

Identifying the cues that lead to non-productive behaviors, like excessive social media use while intending to post AI content, is key. Replace the cue by preparing your social media content in batches and scheduling posts using tools that limit the need to engage actively. This aids in maintaining focus on high-yield activities like coding or content creation while keeping distractions at bay. This small systemic change aligns with both the development of your AI expertise and efficient time management, crucial for a tech entrepreneur.

**The 3rd Law: Make It Easy**

11 **Walk Slowly, but Never Backward**

Focusing on making your necessary habits unavoidable while keeping the unnecessary ones challenging to start is a solid approach. Structure your workspace in your home office to be conducive only to work-related activities. Keep leisure devices or distractions in other parts of the apartment, reinforcing the mental association of your office as a place of productivity.

12 **The Law of Least Effort**

Apply this law by preparing your workspace the night before, ensuring all resources you need for a morning deep-work session on AI development are at hand. This eliminates friction the next morning and makes the transition into work seamless, encouraging you to maintain the habit of starting your day focused on high-priority projects.

13 **How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule**

For tackling smaller, important tasks that feel like chores, simplify them into two-minute starters. For instance, answer a few easy emails or set up the framework for a content piece in two minutes. Often, the act of starting decreases the resistance to completing the task entirely.

14 **How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible**

Technological solutions like website blockers during work hours can help make distractions impossible. Conversely, setting up automated systems that handle routine tasks, such as billing or social media posting, can free up your cognitive resources for more intensive work, making productive habits inevitable.

**The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying**

15 **The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change**

Immediate gratification following an action makes it more likely for that action to become a habit. Recognize small victories by tracking and celebrating progress made on AI projects, perhaps through visual metrics or short reflection sessions to end the workday. These positive reinforcements make your endeavors satisfying and, thus, more sustainable.

16 **How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day**

Creating a routine around ending your workday at a fixed time, and engaging in a rewarding activity afterward, like a session in the infrared sauna or a special dinner with Anastasiia, can make sticking to your schedule satisfying. The pleasure derived from the reward will reinforce your daily commitment to your start and end times.

17 **How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything**

Join or form a mastermind group with fellow entrepreneurs focusing on AI and content creation. Regular meetings where members share progress, challenges, and insights not only provide external accountability but also enrich your learning and commitment to your habits.

**Advanced Tactics: How to Go from Being Merely Good to Being Truly Great**

18 **The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)**

Reflect on how your past experiences, like engaging in rigorous math and computer science studies and internships, have prepared you for your current entrepreneurial endeavors. Leverage these ingrained skills to push beyond the basics and innovate in your field.

19 **The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work**

Keeping challenges optimal will maintain your engagement. As an AI entrepreneur, continuously set learning goals that are neither too easy nor impossibly hard. This could mean developing a new algorithm or applying your AI skills to a new industry vertical.

20 **The Downside of Creating Good Habits**

Be aware of the potential plateaus in habit formation. When routine starts feeling stale, inject new challenges or learning opportunities into your workflow. Possibly, collaborate with experts outside your immediate circle to explore new applications for AI, keeping your interest and engagement alive.

In conclusion, crafting habits that align closely with both your surroundings and your inner ambitions will not only further your entrepreneurial career but also enhance your personal growth and satisfaction.
### Imitating the Many

In the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of experiments that are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. To begin each experiment, the subject entered the room with a group of strangers. Unbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors planted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers to certain questions.

The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a second card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the line on the second card that was similar in length to the line on the first card. It was a very simple task.

### Here is an example of two cards used in the experiment

**CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMS**

**FIGURE 10:** This is a representation of two cards used by Solomon Asch in his famous social conformity experiments. The length of the line on the first card (left) is obviously the same as line C, but when a group of actors claimed it was a different length, research subjects would often change their minds and go with the crowd rather than believe their own eyes.

The experiment always began the same. First, there would be some easy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few rounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as the previous ones, except the actors in the room would select an intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond “A” to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree that the lines we

Imagine yourself in this experiment in a setting where others perhaps are seasoned entrepreneurs or tech leaders. Like in Asch's experiment, their influence could potentially sway your decisions about business strategies or technology adoption, even against better judgment. This social conformity could play out in your interactions within tech communities or networking groups in Dubai, impacting your decisions about AI project directions or adoption of certain technologies, opining towards popular yet not necessarily optimal solutions.

Applying this understanding to your life, it is crucial to maintain grounding in your principles and the detailed visualization/affirmation work you perform, to ensure that the influence of your tech entrepreneur networks - while valuable - does not lead you to stray from your path but rather reinforces it. This awareness can help you navigate your circles in Dubai, leveraging group dynamics positively while strategically standing firm where required. Additionally, your habit of reviewing your visualisation board could act as your touchstone, keeping your professional identity aligned with your personal goals and the unique brand of leadership you aim to develop.
- Asch ran this experiment many times and in many different ways. What he discovered was that as the number of actors increased, so did the conformity of the subject. If it was just the subject and one actor, then there was no effect on the person’s choice. They just assumed they were in the room with a dummy. When two actors were in the room with the subject, there was still little impact. But as the number of people increased to three actors and four and all the way to eight, the subject became more likely to second-guess themselves. By the end of the experiment, nearly 75 percent of the subjects had agreed with the group answer even though it was obviously incorrect.

- Whenever we are unsure how to act, we look to the group to guide our behavior. We are constantly scanning our environment and wondering, “What is everyone else doing?” We check reviews on Amazon or Yelp or TripAdvisor because we want to imitate the “best” buying, eating, and travel habits. It’s usually a smart strategy. There is evidence in numbers.

  - In your situation, as you navigate the tech entrepreneurship scene in Dubai after relocating from Amsterdam, it’s natural to look at how other successful entrepreneurs are structuring their day or integrating work and life. This observational tendency can be harnessed to build productive habits around your AI projects, where aligning with effective practices could accelerate your learning and integration into the new environment.

- But there can be a downside. The normal behavior of the tribe often overpowers the desired behavior of the individual. For example, one study found that when a chimpanzee learns an effective way to crack nuts open as a member of one group and then switches to a new group that uses a less effective strategy, it will avoid using the superior nut cracking method just to blend in with the rest of the chimps.

  - Similarly, you might find that the startup or tech community in Dubai has different work rhythms or social norms compared to what you were accustomed to in Amsterdam. The challenge here is to distinguish when it's beneficial to adapt and when it's best to stick to your effective routines, like your early morning starts at 5 AM which are crucial for your productivity.

### 3. Imitating the Powerful

We are drawn to behaviors that 

  - Reflect the habits of individuals we admire and perceive as powerful or successful. For example, if influential tech leaders share their morning routines or how they manage social media distractions, you might be inclined to adopt similar strategies. This can be particularly impactful for you as you look to establish a strong personal brand and online presence in AI and tech. Recognizing the powerful role models in your field and selectively adopting their habits while still maintaining your unique approach could significantly enhance your personal and professional growth.

## Chapter Summary

# How to Find and Fix the Causes of Your Bad Habits

I. One day, I found myself in my new home in Dubai, settled into a workspace I had meticulously organized for maximum efficiency. It was early morning, around 5:15 AM—an hour I cherished for its quiet and potential. However, this particular morning found me wrestling with a familiar distraction. Instead of diving into an AI project, I was scrolling through Twitter, absorbing content that, while momentarily stimulating, would not propel me toward my goal of becoming a leading voice in the AI community.

Much like Mike, a guide I imagined from a story, who could seamlessly introduce me to the local tech scene in Dubai just as he introduced a traveler to Turkey, I needed guidance on harnessing my environment to foster productive habits. That morning, as the sky lightened and my coffee cooled, I reflected on how this setting—both physical and digital—played a crucial role in my daily behavior patterns.

On my desk lay stacks of unread messages and emails, each a reminder of my tendency to prioritize 'urgent' over the 'important.' These were my cigarettes—the habits that didn't serve my aspirations but were tough to quit. Just like the Turk from Mike’s story confessed starting smoking due to peer influence, I recognized that my surrounding environment and the tech-oriented social media culture significantly shaped these unproductive patterns.

Adapting the lesson from the Polgar sisters' chess regimen, I resolved to transform my environment to better support my entrepreneurial and personal growth ambitions. Like the grandmasters, who structured their days around deep, focused study sessions, I knew I needed to set clear boundaries for my work and personal interactions.

First, turning off notifications during key creative hours would safeguard my concentration. Next, scheduling regular check-ins on social media strictly for brand building, and not personal browsing, would direct my online presence with purpose, reducing digital drift. Lastly, initiating a system where every completed task was followed by a small yet satisfying reward, like a five-minute break or a stretch, would keep my daily routine both stimulating and aligned with my broader goals.

These changes wouldn't just prevent distractions; they would foster an environment where my best work was inevitable. By customizing my day-to-day life to minimize friction toward productivity, I could make my workspace a catalyst for habit formation, thus setting the stage for continuous improvement and closer alignment with the visionary AI leader I aspired to become.
### He says things like:

- - -

- You think you are quitting something, but you're not quitting anything because distractions do nothing for you.
- You think scrolling through social media is something you need to do to stay informed, but it's not. You can be informed without endlessly scrolling.
- You think checking email and messages frequently is about staying connected and productive, but it's not. Constant connectivity disrupts your focus and destroys your productivity.

Over and over, he repeats these phrases and others like them. “Get it clearly into your mind,” he says. “You are losing nothing and you are making marvelous positive gains not only in health, energy and money but also in confidence, self-respect, freedom and, most important of all, in the length and quality of your future life.”

By the time you get to the end of the book, letting these distractions run your day seems like the most ridiculous thing in the world to do. And if you no longer expect these distractions to bring you any benefits, you have no reason to indulge in them. It is an inversion of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change: make it unattractive.

### WHERE CRAVINGS COME FROM

Every behavior has a surface level craving and a deeper, underlying motive. I often have a craving that goes something like this: “I want to check my Twitter feed.” If you were to ask me why I want to check Twitter, I wouldn’t immediately say, “Because I need social interaction and approval.” But the truth is, somewhere deep down, I am motivated to use Twitter because I seek to connect with others and gain their acknowledgment. The underlying motive is to connect and bond with others, even if my specific craving is for social media engagement.

Some of our underlying motives include:

- Conserve energy
- Obtain food and water
- Find love and reproduce
- Connect and bond with others
- Win social acceptance and approval
- Reduce uncertainty
- Achieve status and prestige

A craving is just a specific manifestation of a deeper underlying motive. Your brain did not evolve with a desire to scroll through Instagram or to binge-watch YouTube videos. At a deep level, you simply want to reduce uncertainty and relieve anxiety, to win social acceptance and approval, or to achieve status.

Look at nearly any product that is habit-forming, and you’ll see that it does not create a new motivation, but rather latches onto the underlying motives of human nature.

- Find love and reproduce = using Tinder
- Connect and bond with others = browsing LinkedIn or joining AI communities online
- Win social acceptance and approval = posting content on YouTube
- Reduce uncertainty = searching on Google for the latest AI advancements
- Achieve status and prestige = being acknowledged as a thought leader in the tech space by peers

Your habits are modern-day solutions to ancient desires. New versions of old vices. The underlying motives behind human behavior remain the same. The specific habits we perform differ based on the period of history.

Here’s the powerful part: there are many different ways to address the same underlying motive. One person might learn to reduce social anxiety by mindlessly scrolling social media. You, on the other hand, might choose to satisfy this need by actively engaging with AI communities, sharing your technical knowledge and making meaningful connections. Your current habits are not necessarily the best way to solve the problems you face; they are just the methods y
Habits are all about associations. These associations determine whether we predict a habit to be worth repeating or not. As we covered in our discussion of the 1st Law, your brain is continually absorbing information and noticing cues in the environment. Every time you perceive a cue, your brain runs a simulation and makes a prediction about what to do in the next moment.

- Cue: You notice that the stove is hot.
  - Prediction: If I touch it I'll get burned, so I should avoid touching it.
- Cue: You see that the traffic light turned green.
  - Prediction: If I step on the gas, I’ll make it safely through the intersection and get closer to my destination, so I should step on the gas.

You see a cue, categorize it based on past experience, and determine the appropriate response.

This all happens in an instant, but it plays a crucial role in your habits because every action is preceded by a prediction. Life feels reactive, but it is actually predictive. All day long, you are making your best guess of how to act given what you’ve just seen and what has worked for you in the past. You are endlessly predicting what will happen in the next moment.

Our behavior is heavily dependent on these predictions. Put another way, our behavior is heavily dependent on how we interpret the events that happen to us, not necessarily the objective reality of the events themselves. Two people can look at the same cigarette, and one feels the urge to smoke while the other is repulsed by the smell. The same cue can spark a good habit or a bad habit depending on your prediction. The cause of your habits is actually the prediction that precedes them.

These predictions lead to feelings, which is how we typically describe a craving—a feeling, a desire, an urge. Feelings and emotions transform the cues we perceive and the predictions we make into a signal that we can apply. They help us decide whether to follow through on a habit or not.

- Cue: Your alarm goes off at 5 am.
  - Prediction: Waking up now and starting your day early will allow you to focus on critical AI projects without distractions, so you should get up despite feeling sleepy.
- Cue: You notice your phone's notification while working.
  - Prediction: Checking it might be a distraction but could also be an important message; past experiences of getting distracted make you predict that it’s better to check it during your designated break to maintain deep work focus.

Understanding this habit loop, tailored to the nuances of your personal and professional life in Dubai, helps add clarity to why certain cues trigger specific activities. Whether it's sticking to your early morning wake-up time or managing the lure of social media during work hours, each prediction and subsequent habit forms part of a larger system aimed at refining your tech entrepreneurship and personal well-being.
To better illustrate how the concepts laid out in "Atomic Habits" directly connect to your life, consider your daily interaction with social media—a common cue that initiates a multitude of behaviors. Often, the act of checking Twitter or Instagram isn’t driven by a need to use social media itself but stems from a deeper craving to shift your internal state. For instance, while working on your AI projects, you might feel stuck or in need of a distraction. It’s not the social media that you desire but, perhaps, a momentary relief from the cognitive load or challenge you're facing. 

The gap between feeling mentally taxed and wanting to feel lighter or entertained provides a reason to act—this is where unnecessary browsing kicks in. In your case, recognizing this craving as a signal and then substituting it with a more beneficial action, like a brief stretching session or a quick walk around your apartment, can lead to better outcomes. This replacement not only addresses your need for a mental break but also enhances your physical well-being, aligning more closely with your identity as a healthy, disciplined entrepreneur.

Furthermore, relating this process to your aspiration of waking up at 5 AM sharply illustrates how emotions and feelings can either support or hinder your habits. When your alarm rings, there’s often an immediate discomfort or displeasure, pushing you to go back to sleep. However, if you cultivate the emotional response to interpret waking up early as a decisive step towards a successful, productive day—akin to winning a personal victory—you start to reshape your internal incentive structure.

Neurologically, this shift in perception taps into the emotional feedback loop that Antonio Damasio describes. Feel Good by changing how you perceive early mornings from a chore to an empowering choice, enhances your ability to automate this habit. It’s not just about adjusting your sleep schedule; it’s about realigning your emotional responses to better serve your overarching goals of efficiency and self-discipline.

To apply this insight directly, use your morning visualization routine as a cue not only to plan your day but also to viscerally remind yourself why you commit to these early mornings. Each visualization of your successful future self reinforces the emotional reward of waking up early, making it more satisfying and, thus, more sustainable as a habit.

This approach not only streamlines your habit formation but also ensures that each habit developed is a building block towards the comprehensive identity of a successful tech entrepreneur and influential thought leader you aspire to become.
### HOW TO REPROGRAM YOUR BRAIN TO ENJOY HARD HABITS

- You can make hard habits more attractive if you can learn to associate them with a positive experience. Sometimes, all you need is a slight mind-set shift. For instance, we often talk about everything we have to do in a given day. You have to wake up early for work. You have to make another sales call for your business. You have to cook dinner for your family.

- Now, imagine changing just one word: You don’t “have” to. You “get” to. You get to wake up early for work. You get to make another sales call for your business. You get to cook dinner for your family. By simply changing one word, you shift the way you view each event. You transition from seeing these behaviors as burdens and turn them into opportunities.

- The key point is that both versions of reality are true. You have to do those things, and you also get to do them. We can find evidence for whatever mind-set we choose.

- **For example, consider your early morning struggle to wake up at 5 am. Rather than viewing it as a chore, shift the perspective to: "I get to wake up at 5 am to have more hours to innovate in the AI field, which is my passion." This reframes your morning routine from a grueling task to an empowering opportunity to lead the day with your interests.**

- I once heard a story about a man who uses a wheelchair. When asked if it was difficult being confined, he responded, “I’m not confined to my wheelchair—I am liberated by it. If it wasn't for my wheelchair, I would be bed-bound and never able to leave my house.” This shift in perspective completely transformed how he lived each day.

- **Similarly, consider your move to Dubai; rather than seeing it as a barrier causing routine disruptions, view it as a liberating chance to explore new environments, culture, and opportunities that could inspire fresh ideas for both your personal and professional life. This kind of reframing makes the habit of exploring the new city much more attractive.**

- Reframing your habits to highlight their benefits rather than their drawbacks is a fast and lightweight way to reprogram your mind and make a habit seem more attractive.

### Exercise
- Many people associate exercise with being a challenging task that drains energy and wears you down. You can just as easily view it as a way to develop skills and build you up. **For instance, redefine your fluctuating workout schedule as a flexible routine that allows you to select from a variety of physical activities like HYROX races or morning runs, matching your daily energy levels and preferences, thereby enriching your fitness experience and enhancing your agility and coordination, important aspects of your identity as a developed sportsman.** Instead of telling yourself "I need to go run in the morning,
### Finance
- Saving money is often associated with sacrifice. However, as a burgeoning tech entrepreneur, I can associate it with freedom rather than limitation if I realize one simple truth: living below my current means increases my future means. The money I save this month increases my purchasing power next month. In the context of launching an AI startup, this approach will accelerate my ability to invest in better resources and tools, empowering my business to scale effectively and sustainably.

### Meditation
- Anyone who has tried meditation for more than three seconds knows how frustrating it can be when the next distraction inevitably pops into the mind. As I settle into my new home in Dubai and juggle the demands of developing a personal brand and managing startup tasks, meditation could seem more challenging. Yet, I can transform this frustration into delight when I realize that each interruption gives me a chance to practice returning to my breath. Distraction is a good thing because I need distractions to practice improving my focus—a critical skill for both coding and strategic thinking.

- Pregame jitters are common in challenging situations, much like the tension I might feel before a significant presentation or product launch. They manifest as quicker breathing, a faster heart rate, and heightened arousal. If I interpret these feelings negatively, then I feel threatened and tense up. If I reframe these sensations positively, interpreting them as "I am excited and I’m getting an adrenaline rush to help me concentrate," I can respond with fluidity and grace. This mind-set can significantly alter my performance during pivotal moments with clients or stakeholders.

These little mind-set shifts aren't magic, but they can help to change the feelings I associate with particular habits or situations that are crucial in my entrepreneurial and personal development.

If I want to take it a step further, I can create a motivation ritual. By associating habits with something I enjoy—such as playing a specific song or podcast episode about AI breakthroughs right before entering my deep work mode—I can harness this cue whenever I need a motivational boost. Much like Ed Latimore found focus simply by wearing his headphones, I might discover that certain rituals can magnify my concentration and productivity without significant effort, setting a conditioned environment for success.
g it, he was conditioning himself. In the beginning, he put his headphones on, played some music he enjoyed, and did focused work. After doing it five, ten, twenty times, putting his headphones on became a cue that he automatically associated with increased focus. The craving followed naturally. 

Imagine this scenario tailored to your own routine in Dubai: you set up a specific morning cue where right after waking up at 5 am, you spend a few minutes planning your day in your dedicated home office. This consistent action cultivates a routine that automatically shifts you into a deep work mode, crucial for working on AI projects without distractions.

Athletes use similar strategies to get themselves in the mind-set to perform. During my baseball career, I developed a specific ritual of stretching and throwing before each game. The whole sequence took about ten minutes, and I did it the same way every single time. While it physically warmed me up to play, more importantly, it put me in the right mental state. I began to associate my pregame ritual with feeling competitive and focused. Even if I wasn’t motivated beforehand, by the time I was done with my ritual, I was in “game mode.”

You can adapt this strategy for your workout regimen. You've mentioned that your exercise times fluctuate; however, creating a consistent pre-exercise routine, like a warm-up playlist or a set stretch sequence, can condition your mind to transition into workout mode consistently, making your training sessions more effective and habitual.

You can adapt this strategy for nearly any purpose. Say you want to feel happier in general. Find something that makes you truly happy—like enjoying a quiet morning coffee in your living room—and then create a short routine that you perform every time before you do the thing you love. Maybe you take three deep breaths and think of one thing you're grateful for that day.

Three deep breaths. Think gratitude. Sip the coffee. Repeat.

Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-gratitude routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed with a challenging AI problem? Take three deep breaths and think of a recent success. Sad about missing Amsterdam? Three deep breaths and plan a small weekend exploration in Dubai with Anastasiia.

- The key to finding and fixing the causes of your bad habits is to reframe the associations you have about them. It's not easy, but if you can reprogram your predictions, you can transform a hard habit into an attractive one. For instance, the negativity you feel towards social media could be reframed by associating social media time strictly with sharing your AI advancements and learning from others, not mindless scrolling.

### HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT

#### The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

- 1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them. For example, jot down your routine from the moment you aim to wake up at 5 am, through your intensive focus on AI development, to the end of your workday. Recognize where your habits support or detract from your goals.
  
- 1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” Make this specific to your circumstance; for example, “I will review my visualisation/affirmation board at 5:15 AM in my cabinet.”
  
- 1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” Since you already start your day with priority work, stack the habit of a mid-morning break for stretching or a walk, to continue the day refreshed. “After completing my morning AI development session, I will take a 10-minute stretching break.”

- 1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. Keep your affirmation board in a prominent place where you'll see it right after waking up. Organize your workspace to minimize distractions, perhaps keeping your phone in a drawer until 1 pm.

#### The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

- 2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. For instance, listen to a business podcast you enjoy while handling email or routine tasks that you tend to put off.
  
- 2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Engage more actively in AI communities online where sharing progress and projects is commonplace, boosting your motivation to produce meaningful content himself.
  
- 2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. Since you enjoy a deep dive into AI projects, precede this work by a brief session of reading or a small wellness activity like a sauna session to enhance focus and enjoyment.

#### The 3rd Law: Make It Easy

- Simplify the process of your important daily tasks. For instance, prepare your workspace the night before for your early morning start. Also, set up templates or workflows for routine tasks like social media updates to streamline the process and prevent decision fatigue.

#### The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

- Providing immediate satisfaction can support your habit formation. Reward finishing a challenging task like content production with a favourite activity, maybe a brief workout or an ice bath, linking a sense of accomplishment with relaxation and health benefits.

# How To Break A Bad Habit

- Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible
  - 1.5: Reduce exposure to distractions. Keep your phone and social media notifications off until 1 pm. This minimizes the cues related to your habit of reaching for your phone and getting sidetracked by non-essential tasks.

- Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive
  - 2.4: Reframe your mindset. Understanding the downfalls of sporadic sleeping and the benefits of a consistent bedtime could help you shift your frame of viewing sleep discipline. Emphasize the negative outcomes of irregular habits and the benefits of stability and routine.

- Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult
- Inversion of the 4th Law: Make It Unsatisfying

By adjusting these habits and laws to your specific lifestyle and goals, especially around your focus on AI, content development, and personal wellness, you create a robust system that supports your identity and professional aspirations effectively.
### **🔁 What are habits?**

Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. By focusing on minor enhancements, repeating positive efforts, even as something seemingly small as reserving your first working hour for undisturbed deep work on AI projects, you start building up a massive return over time.

> And when we repeat 1% errors, day after day, through replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalising little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.

### **🧑‍⚖️ There are 4 laws of behaviour change that we can use to create good habits and break the bad ones**

A single habit is made of a **cue, craving, response, and reward**. Optimizing these components using the 4 laws of behavior change can significantly improve your daily productivity and well-being:

1. **Make it obvious** – Picture your daily routine: placing your gym clothes next to your bed the night before makes it obvious and effortless to gear up and commence your morning workout, a pivotal start to a high-energy day.
   
2. **Make it attractive** – Knowing that engaging deeply in your AI research first thing each morning leads to significant progressive insights can make this habit attractive, fueling your drive to jump into work immediately after your workout.
   
3. **Make it easy** – Arrange your workspace the night before with the necessary tools and open files on your computer. This arrangement reduces friction, making it easy to dive straight into deep work with AI after your morning routine.
   
4. **Make it immediately satisfying** – Reward yourself post-workout with a wholesome breakfast that includes oatmeal, nuts, and honey. This pleasant meal serves as an immediate reward, encouraging the continuation of your morning routine.

### **⏳ It takes time to build or break a habit and that’s why most people quit halfway**

Time magnifies the margin between success and failure. It will multiply whatever you feed it. If you consistently feed your days with productive work and positive habits, like your morning routine of workout followed by deep work on AI, time will amplify this into significant achievements.

### ⚙️ Adopt a systems-first approach instead of focusing on goals

Forget about the immediate outcomes; focus more on refining your daily systems. For example, improving how you structure your deep work sessions or your content creation process for YouTube can gradually lead to mastery, much more effectively than fixating on subscriber numbers or immediate feedback.

### **🪞 To form good habits, make them a part of your identity**

Start believing you are a disciplined tech entrepreneur who values deep work and a clear division between work and distractions. Reinforce this identity by structuring your environment to minimize distractions, perhaps by using tools that limit social media access during work hours. Each action of resisting a distraction or completing a task strengthens this self-perception, thereby solidifying your identity as someone who is focused and effective. 

*Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.*

Building this business and lifestyle you dream of starts with every little habit you reinforce daily. Whether it’s the discipline in waking up early, managing your diet, or how you schedule your day, each is a building block towards becoming the tech maestro you aspire to be. As you mold your habits around your identity as a leader and an innovator in the AI space, each day propels you a step closer to that reality.
### HOW LONG DOES IT ACTUALLY TAKE TO FORM A NEW HABIT?

Habit formation is the process by which a behavior becomes progressively more automatic through repetition. The more you repeat an activity, the more the structure of your brain changes to become efficient at that activity.

Neuroscientists call this long-term potentiation, which refers to the strengthening of connections between neurons in the brain based on recent patterns of activity. With consistent and persistent repetition, you, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur focusing on mastering AI, can make your endeavors in AI project development and content creation more instinctive. Every day that you spend focusing on these tasks not only builds your expertise but also solidifies your identity as a leader in the tech community.

Imagine the satisfaction of automating the process of waking up at 5 am, now powered by a developed habit rather than sheer willpower. As you've mentioned, though challenging, this can create essential space in the early mornings for deep, uninterrupted work—perhaps on complex AI algorithms or scripting the next YouTube video that aligns with building your brand.

Habitual repetition of strategic planning sessions can reduce the friction you feel towards routine tasks, and systematically addressing these can free up more resources for higher-value work. The same principle applies when avoiding time-consuming distractions; if you habitually train yourself to turn off your devices and gain deep focus, you will likely see your productivity levels spike.

Your workouts, previously fluctuating in time and duration, can benefit from a more rigid schedule. This repetition will not only improve physical health but also mental toughness, which is indispensable when rewriting your script as a tech maestro. Every push-up, every sprint, every coding session casts a vote for this new identity.

By embedding these habit formations deeply into your daily routines, you can effectively thrust your personal and professional life towards the comprehensive vision you hold for yourself. As these habits strengthen, they will undergird your success, turning complex challenges into tasks you navigate effortlessly.
- Phenomenon is commonly known as Hebb’s Law: “Neurons that fire together wire together.”
- Mathematicians, meanwhile, have increased gray matter in the inferior parietal lobule, which plays a key role in computation and calculation. Its size is directly correlated with the same dedication you've shown in your studies and competitions in math during your high school and university years. Just as these regions of your brain developed through intense and repeated focus on mathematical problems, your current venture in AI can similarly strengthen specific neural pathways.
- When scientists analyzed the brains of taxi drivers in London, they found that the hippocampus—a region of the brain involved in spatial memory—was significantly larger in their subjects than in non-taxi drivers. Even more fascinating, the hippocampus decreased in size when a driver retired. Like these taxi drivers, your adaptive neural changes due to your rigorous training in AI and deep learning will adjust based on how continuously and intensively you engage with these technologies.
- Of course, the importance of repetition in establishing habits was recognized long before neuroscientists began poking around. In 1860, the English philosopher George H. Lewes noted, “In learning to speak a new language, to play on a musical instrument, or to perform unaccustomed movements, great difficulty is felt, because the channels through which each sensation has to pass have not become established; but no sooner has frequent repetition cut a pathway, than this difficulty vanishes; the actions become so automatic that they can be performed while the mind is otherwise engaged.” This principle can be directly applied to your current challenges in distinguishing between work and personal life, as establishing clear, repeated boundaries will make this separation more automatic.
- Each time you repeat an action, you are activating a particular neural circuit associated with that habit.
- It is why the students who took tons of photos improved their skills while those who merely theorized about perfect photos did not. One group engaged in active practice, the other in passive learning. One in action, the other in stagnation. Similarly, your active daily engagement in AI projects or creation of YouTube content, rather than merely planning or thinking about these tasks, directly enhances your expertise and influencer status in the tech community.
### It looks something like this

**THE HABIT LINE**

**AUTOMATICITY**

**REPETITIONS**

**FIGURE 11:** In the beginning (point A), a habit requires a good deal of effort and concentration to perform. After a few repetitions (point B), it gets easier, but still requires some conscious attention. With enough practice (point C), the habit becomes more automatic than conscious. Beyond this threshold—the habit line—the behavior can be done more or less without thinking. A new habit has been formed.

On the following page, you’ll see what it looks like when researchers track the level of automaticity for an actual habit like walking for ten minutes each day.

The shape of these charts, which scientists call learning curves, reveals an important truth about behavior change: habits form based on frequency, not time.

**WALKING 10 MINUTES PER DAY**

# AUTOMATICITY

- Day

FIGURE 12: This graph shows someone who built the habit of walking for ten minutes after breakfast each day. Notice that as the repetitions increase, so does automaticity, until the behavior is as easy and automatic as it can be.

One of the most common questions I hear is, “How long does it take to build a new habit?” But what people really should be asking is, “How many does it take to form a new habit?” That is, how many repetitions are required to make a habit automatic?

Your current habits have been internalized over the course of hundreds, if not thousands, of repetitions. New habits require the same level of frequency. You need to string together enough successful attempts until the behavior is firmly embedded in your mind and you cross the Habit Line.

In practice, it doesn’t really matter how long it takes for a habit to become automatic. What matters is that you take the actions you need to take to make your system run. For your goal of waking up at 5 am every day, focus on repeating the process of setting and adhering to a strict bedtime routine. Track your progress on a chart by your bed, noting each successful early rise, similar to the graph tracking the walking habit after breakfast.

## Chapter Summary

### 12

**The Law of Least Effort**

1. IN HIS AWARD-WINNING BOOK, *Guns, Germs, and Steel*, anthropologist and biologist Jared Diamond points out that in the evolution of human societies, those that succeed and thrive are often those that adopt strategies requiring the least effort to sustain. This principle can be directly applied to your ambitions in creating a thriving AI-centered business and a focused personal life. Minimizing distractions and creating a conducive environment in your home office in Dubai will lower the effort required to engage deeply with your work. For instance, you can make your office a 'tech-only' zone during specific high-productivity hours to prevent personal life interruptions and hone your focus on AI and content creation.

By aligning your daily activities to the Law of Least Effort, you essentially pave the path of least resistance toward fulfilling your identity as a successful tech entrepreneur and a balanced individual. This also applies to your fitness and relationships—scheduling fixed workout times and regular check-ins with your girlfriend and family can transform these efforts into seamless, rewarding routines.
    **THE SHAPE OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR**

- **EAST - WEST ORIENTATION**

- **NORTH - SOUTH ORIENTATION**

**FIGURE 13:** The primary axis of Europe and Asia is east-west. The primary axis of the Americas and Africa is north-south. This leads to a wider range of climates up-and-down the Americas than across Europe and Asia. As a result, agriculture spread nearly twice as fast across Europe and Asia than it did elsewhere. The behavior of farmers—even across hundreds or thousands of years—was constrained by the amount of friction in the environment.

By comparison, the climate varies greatly when traveling from north to south. Just as you've experienced moving from Amsterdam to Dubai, adapting to a new environment requires adjusting your habits and routines to align with local conditions. This can be akin to a farmer needing different strategies and crops to succeed in different climates. You can be the most talented AI entrepreneur in the world, but without adapting your daily habits and systems to the unique demands of your new Dubai environment, like managing your energy peaks and understanding local business rhythms, your productivity might not flourish as expected. Just as crops might struggle in unsuitable climates, your work and personal habits need the right environment to thrive without unnecessary friction.
As a tech entrepreneur with a focus on AI, you're accustomed to the principle of optimization, seeking the most effective routes to solve complex problems. This aligns closely with the **3rd Law of Behavior Change: Make It Easy**, which essentially revolves around navigating the path of least resistance for maximal consistency in your habits.

**Energy is precious, and the brain is wired to conserve it whenever possible.** It is human nature to follow the Law of Least Effort, which states that when deciding between two similar options, people will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work. For instance, consider your goal to wake up at 5 am daily to maximize productivity. Initially, this might seem challenging because it demands a shift from your usual routine. To make this easier, you could streamline your evening routine to wind down efficiently by 8:30 pm. Think of it like optimizing a function in programming: you're simplifying the variables (night-time activities) to ensure the function (waking up early) runs smoothly.

**Every action requires a certain amount of energy. The more energy required, the less likely it is to occur.** If your goal is to work out consistently every day, liken this to a software algorithm that needs to run efficiently under different conditions. The more complex the algorithm (or workout), the more computational resources (or personal energy) it demands. Therefore, by simplifying your workout routine or scheduling it at a fixed time daily, you reduce cognitive load and energy expenditure, thus making it more likely that you'll stick to it. Just as you would choose to streamline processes in algorithmic trading or AI tasks to improve efficiency, applying the same principle to your workout routine will yield better adherence and results.

By understanding and applying the **3rd Law of Behavior Change**, you can engineer your daily life with the same precision and efficiency that you apply to your professional AI projects.
## HOW TO ACHIEVE MORE WITH LESS EFFORT

Imagine you are holding a garden hose that is bent in the middle. Suppose the water flowing through it represents the energy and effort you expend daily. As an aspiring AI entrepreneur working from home, your life's efficiency might often feel hindered by intricate bends in your routine—the distractions from social media, the blurred boundaries between work and personal life with Anastasiia, and the fluctuation in your workout times.

Now, think of straightening that hose as equivalent to streamlining your day: when the path is clear, the water flows smoothly and effortlessly. The same concept applies to your daily habits. The habit of doing one push-up per day requires almost no energy to get started. And the less energy a habit requires, the more likely it is to occur.

Look at any behavior that occupies much of your life and you’ll see that it can be performed with very low levels of motivation. Habits like scrolling on your phone, checking email, and watching YouTube tutorials steal so much of your time because they can be performed almost without effort. They are remarkably convenient.

In a sense, every habit is just an obstacle to getting what you really want. Dieting is an obstacle to getting fit. Meditation is an obstacle to feeling calm. Journaling is an obstacle to thinking clearly. You don’t actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle—that is, the more difficult the habit—the more friction there is between you and your desired end state. This is why it is crucial to make your habits so easy that you’ll do them even when you don’t feel like it. If you can make your good habits more convenient, you’ll be more likely to follow through on them.

But what about all the moments when we seem to do the opposite? If we’re all so lazy, then how do you explain people accomplishing hard things like raising a child or starting a business or climbing Mount Everest?

Certainly, you are capable of doing very hard things. The problem is that some days you feel like doing the hard work and some days you feel like giving in. On tough days, when disruptions like uncertain eating schedules or unread messages tempt you to stray from your goals, it’s crucial to have as many things working in your favor as possible so that you can overcome the challenges life naturally throws your way. The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge.

The idea behind make it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run. Reducing the friction in starting your deep work sessions, such as maintaining a clear boundary with Anastasiia during your work hours or turning off your phone while creating content, supports the effortless flow of productivity, mirroring the unobstructed flow of water through a straightened hose. This ease of initiation ensures that despite the daily bends, your efforts continue uninterrupted towards achieving the feats akin to summiting your entrepreneurial Mount Everest.
Trying to pump up your motivation to stick with a hard habit is like trying to force water through a bent hose. You can do it, but it requires a lot of effort and increases the tension in your life. Meanwhile, making your habits simple and easy is like removing the bend in the hose. Rather than trying to overcome the friction in your life, you reduce it.

One of the most effective ways to reduce the friction associated with your habits is to practice environment design. In Chapter 6, we discussed environment design as a method for making cues more obvious, but you can also optimize your environment to make actions easier. For example, when deciding where to practice a new habit, it is best to choose a place that is already along the path of your daily routine. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of your life. You are more likely to adhere to your programming schedule if your home office is set up efficiently—ideally away from distractions like the living room where you might encounter interruptions from your living situation or impromptu social media checks.

Perhaps even more effective is reducing the friction within your home or office. Too often, we try to start habits in high-friction environments. We try to follow a productive work morning while having notifications enabled on our smartphones, filled with distractions. We try to work on developing AI and producing high-quality content for YouTube in the same environment where we relax and unwind. It doesn’t have to be this way. We can remove the points of friction that hold us back. This is akin to what you might need in your transition from algorithmic trading to becoming an influential tech entrepreneur where your environment can either hinder or promote your progress.

With your move to Dubai, optimizing your new working environment will be crucial. For instance, organizing your office to minimize clutter and setting clear boundaries for work-life balance could dramatically decrease the friction associated with your habit formation. If the goal is to start your workday by 5 am and reduce distractions, consider a nightly routine where you prepare your workspace for the next day, perhaps laying out priority tasks the night before, which could also serve as a cue for your deep work sessions.

This adjustment to your environment simplifies the process of engaging in your high-value work activities, akin to removing the bend in the hose, allowing productivity to flow more freely in your daily routine.
James Surowiecki writes:

“Japanese firms emphasized what came to be known as ‘lean production,’ relentlessly looking to remove waste of all kinds from the production process, down to redesigning workspaces, so workers didn’t have to waste time twisting and turning to reach their tools. The result was that Japanese factories were more efficient and Japanese products were more reliable than American ones. In 1974, service calls for American-made color televisions were five times as common as for Japanese televisions. By 1979, it took American workers three times as long to assemble their sets.”

I like to refer to this strategy as addition by subtraction. The Japanese companies looked for every point of friction in the manufacturing process and eliminated it. As they subtracted wasted effort, they added customers and revenue. Similarly, when we remove the points of friction that sap our time and energy, we can achieve more with less effort. (This is one reason tidying up can feel so good: we are simultaneously moving forward and lightening the cognitive load our environment places on us.)

If you look at the most habit-forming products, you’ll notice that one of the things these goods and services do best is remove little bits of friction from your life. Meal delivery services reduce the friction of shopping for groceries. Dating apps reduce the friction of making social introductions. Ride-sharing services reduce the friction of getting across town. Text messaging reduces the friction of sending a letter in the mail.

Like a Japanese television manufacturer redesigning their workspace to reduce wasted motion, successful companies design their products to automate, eliminate, or simplify as many steps as possible. They reduce the number of fields on each form. They pare down the number of clicks required to create an account. They deliver their products with easy-to-understand directions or ask their customers to make fewer choices.

# PRIME THE ENVIRONMENT FOR FUTURE USE

Oswald Nuckols, an IT developer from Natchez, Mississippi, understands the power of priming his environment, a concept that you, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur in Dubai, can employ in your quest for efficiency and productivity amidst your busy schedule.

Nuckols dialed in his cleaning habits by adopting a strategy he refers to as “resetting the room." For instance, when he is done watching television, he places the remote back on the TV stand, arranges the pillows on the couch, and folds the blanket. He practices similar habits with other spaces, too. When he leaves his car, he throws away any trash that might be inside. Whenever he takes a shower, he wipes down the toilet while the shower is warming up. As he notes, the “perfect time to clean the toilet is right before you wash yourself in the shower anyway.”

The purpose of resetting each room is not merely to clean up after the fact but to prime each space for its next use. This is where you can draw a significant parallel in setting up your working cabinet at home. Considering your description of often getting distracted by routine tasks and the need to maintain boundaries during deep work sessions, employing the ‘resetting the room’ strategy in your workspace can promote a more focused and undistracted environment. For example, at the end of your workday, prepare your workspace for the next morning: organize your desk, line up your notes for the next day's top priority tasks, prep your computer by closing unnecessary tabs, and set your AI project files ready for immediate use when you start your day.

This habit of ‘resetting the room’ could extend to your digital environment as well. Just as you prepare your physical workspace, you might declutter your digital desktop, close tabs that distract you or even use website blockers to keep social media away during work hours. This reduction in both physical and digital clutter is an excellent strategy to boost productivity and decrease the amount of friction when starting your day and transitioning between tasks.

Nuckols’s strategy exemplifies the broader principle: prime environments to reduce the friction of starting good habits and increase the friction of slipping into bad ones. For your night routine to ensure you wake up at 5 am consistently, consider adapting your environment—be it setting a strict time to power down electronic devices, preparing a calming bedtime routine, or laying out your workout clothes if morning exercise is your first task. Small tweaks in your evening routine can greatly effect in achieving your goal of a disciplined sleep schedule while living with your partner.

Similarly, addressing your problem with frequent social media distractions while working on content creation can be mitigated by using apps that allow you to schedule posts without needing to manually engage with platforms susceptible to endless scrolling.

By considering these practical adjustments within your environment, both physical and digital, you'll find it progressively easier to stick to your desired habits, fostering a productive, focused lifestyle that directly contributes to your visions of becoming a revered tech entrepreneur and content creator.
“When I walk into a room everything is in its right place,” Nuckols wrote. “Because I do this every day in every room, stuff always stays in good shape... . People think I work hard but I’m actually really lazy. I’m just proactively lazy. It gives you so much time back.”

Whenever you organize a space for its intended purpose, you are priming it to make the next action easy. For instance, my wife keeps a box of greeting cards that are presorted by occasion—birthday, sympathy, wedding, graduation, and more. Whenever necessary, she grabs an appropriate card and sends it off. She is incredibly good at remembering to send cards because she has reduced the friction of doing so. For years, I was the opposite. Someone would have a baby and I would think, “I should send a card.” But then weeks would pass and by the time I remembered to pick one up at the store, it was too late. The habit wasn’t easy.

There are many ways to prime your environment so it’s ready for immediate use. If you want to cook a healthy breakfast, place the skillet on the stove, set the cooking spray on the counter, and lay out any plates and utensils you’ll need the night before. When you wake up, making breakfast will be easy. Similarly, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur who values starting the day effectively, you could prepare your workspace the evening before. Set out your notepad, pen, and programming books on your desk within your home cabinet. Lay out any resources you need for your morning deep work session on AI development or content creation. This preparation primes your environment for immediate productivity upon starting your day.

- Want to draw more? Put your pencils, pens, notebooks, and drawing tools on top of your desk, within easy reach.
- Want to exercise? Set out your workout clothes, shoes, gym bag, and water bottle ahead of time. Just as you set aside time for regular workouts, having your gear ready can help you maintain consistency even on busy days or when you feel less motivated.
- Want to improve your diet? Chop up a ton of fruits and vegetables on weekends and pack them in containers, so you have easy access to healthy, ready-to-eat options during the week.

These are simple ways to make the good habit the path of least resistance.

You can also invert this principle and prime the environment to make bad behaviors difficult. If you find yourself watching too much television, for example, then unplug it after each use. Only plug it back in if you can say out loud the name of the show. Similarly, considering your problem with social media distractions, you could schedule specific time slots for checking these platforms and keep your devices in another room or switched off during deep work sessions. This setup creates a barrier to the habit of continuously checking updates, aiding in maintaining your focus on important tasks.
If that doesn’t do it, you can take it a step further. Unplug your laptop and store it away after each use, so it takes extra time to set it up again. This added friction ensures that you only dive into work or social media when it's truly necessary.

- Whenever possible, I leave my phone in a different room until lunch. When it’s right next to me, I’ll check it all morning for no reason at all. But when it is in another room, I rarely think about it. And the friction is high enough that I won’t go get it without a reason. As a result, I get three to four hours each morning when I can work without interruption.

- If sticking your phone in another room doesn’t seem like enough, tell Anastasiia or a friend to keep it from you during your peak work hours. Even asking a remote colleague to check in and remind you to stay off your phone until a certain time can help enforce this behavior.

It is remarkable how little friction is required to prevent unwanted behavior. If I set a home workstation that's only for work—no personal browsing allowed—I find it easier to focus. When I delete distracting apps from my phone, it can be weeks before I download them again and log in. These tricks are unlikely to curb a true addiction, but for many of us, a little bit of friction can be the difference between sticking with a good habit or sliding into a bad one. Imagine the cumulative impact of making dozens of these changes and living in an environment designed to make the good behaviors easier and the bad behaviors harder.

Whether we are approaching behavior change as an individual, a parent, a coach, or a leader, we should ask ourselves the same question: "How can we design a world where it's easy to do what's right?" Redesign your life so the actions that matter most are also the actions that are easiest to perform, like limiting your early hours to deep work on AI without the temptation to scroll through social media, thereby intensifying focus and productivity.

## Chapter Summary

- Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
- Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
- Reduce the friction associated with good behaviors. When friction is low, habits are easy.
- Increase the friction associated with bad behaviors. When friction is high, habits are difficult.
- Prime your environment to make future actions easier.

Imagine your goal of waking up at 5 am every day to optimize your productivity and give undivided attention to your AI projects. By planning your morning routine the night before—laying out your clothes, pre-setting your coffee machine, and scheduling your first task of the day—you can streamline the early hours and make it easier to start the day without unnecessary decisions, thus adhering to the Law of Least Effort.

- How to Stop Procrastinating by Using the Two-Minute Rule

Imagine the scenario: you've just moved to Dubai and are finding the adjustment challenging, particularly in balancing routine tasks with more strategic, high-value work like AI development or content creation. The Two-Minute Rule can particularly help here. For instance, tackle an easy initial step of a task—like opening your content creation software and setting up a new document for a YouTube script—within two minutes. It might seem minor, but taking this simple action sets a momentum that can lead to more substantial engagement in the task, making it more likely that you'll carry through with more in-depth work.

Similarly, considering the multitude of small tasks that disrupt your focus, you could apply the Two-Minute Rule to sort them quickly or delegate them if each action can be started in under two minutes. This approach helps you maintain focus on AI innovation without the drain of shifting too often to minor tasks.

Consider the intricate mornings where you endeavor to balance your personal life with your significant other while maintaining an ambitious awakening routine. Simplifying and habituating the start of your day with the Two-Minute Rule can afford you more ease and consistency. For example, using two minutes in the morning to reinforce your visualisation exercise would not only rally your focus but also reconnect you to your broader aspirations regularly, embedding your identity as a dedicated and visionary tech entrepreneur deeply committed to your craft and personal growth.
Habits are automatic choices that influence the conscious decisions that follow. Yes, a habit can be completed in just a few seconds, but it can also shape the actions that you take for minutes or hours afterward.

Habits are like the entrance ramp to a highway. They lead you down a path

And, before you know it, you’re speeding toward the next behavior. It seems to be easier to continue what you are already doing than to start doing something different. You sit through a bad movie for two hours. You keep snacking even when you’re already full. You check your phone for “just a second” and soon you have spent twenty minutes staring at the screen. In this way, the habits you follow without thinking often determine the choices you make when you are thinking.

Each evening, there is a tiny moment—usually around 5:15 p.m.—that shapes the rest of my night. My wife walks in the door from work and either we change into our workout clothes and head to the gym or we crash onto the couch, order Indian food, and watch The Office. Similar to Twyla Tharp hailing the cab, the ritual is changing into my workout clothes. If I change clothes, I know the workout will happen. Everything that follows—driving to the gym, deciding which exercises to do, stepping under the bar—is easy once I’ve taken the first step.

In your case, a similar decisive moment might occur early in your morning when you have committed to waking up at 5 am. This is the fork in the road for you: do you rise immediately upon hearing your alarm, thus setting a productive tone for the day, or do you hit snooze and potentially disrupt your morning routine? The act of getting out of bed and starting your day with a review of your visualization/affirmation board can function just like changing into workout clothes—it’s the small habit that catalyzes the chain reaction of productivity and focus, essential for your AI projects and content creation.

Every day, there are a handful of moments that deliver an outsized impact. I refer to these little choices as decisive moments. The moment you decide between continuing work or checking social media can tremendously impact your focus and productivity. The moment you choose between addressing your stack of lower-priority tasks or diving straight into deep work on your most important project. These choices are a fork in the road.

# Decisive Moments

- Continuing work or checking social media
- Addressing small tasks or engaging in deep work on major projects
- Choosing to stick to your eating plan or giving into a spontaneous snack

Each decision can significantly influence the path of your day—will it be a day where you maintain discipline and make progress towards your goals, or one where distractions diminish your effectiveness?

# Good

- Focused work session

- Adherence to healthy eating

- Engaging in deep, uninterrupted work

# Bad

- Succumbing to social media distractions

- Snacking outside planned meals

- Choosing easier, less important tasks over critical deep work

FIGURE 14: The difference between a good day and a bad day often comes down to a few key decisive moments. For you, recognizing these moments and handling them effectively can help maintain the disciplined, focused lifestyle you aspire to, ultimately supporting your ambitions as a tech entrepreneur and AI expert.

### THE TWO-MINUTE RULE

Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the Two-Minute Rule, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”

You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version:

- “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
- “Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
- “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
- “Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”
- “Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”

The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. For you, aspiring to become a legendary tech entrepreneur and optimize your mornings, “Waking up at 5 am” becomes “Setting the alarm before bed”. Recognizing the small steps can build habits efficiently without overwhelming your day-to-day, especially in your transition to a new city like Dubai where you are establishing new routines.

Furthermore, adjusting high-impact AI project work or content creation into manageable units each morning could involve starting with something as small as, "Review yesterday’s AI project work," or "Outline one key point for today’s YouTube content." This two-minute initial action serves as a gateway into deeper focus and productivity, allowing you to minimize distractions in your workday while still living with your significant other, respecting each other's space and time for deep work.
away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.

You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.

- Put on your running shoes
- Walk ten minutes
- Walk ten thousand steps
- Run a 5K
- Run a marathon

- Write one sentence
- Write one paragraph
- Write one thousand words
- Write a five-thousand-word article
- Write a book

- Open your notes
- Study for ten minutes
- Study for three hours
- Get straight A’s
- Earn a PhD

If you can't learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. For you, the simple act of shutting off your phone and leaving it in another room while you work could be your key gateway habit. This small step eliminates immediate distractions and sets the stage for deep, undisturbed focus on your AI projects or content creation, echoing the same effect as putting on running shoes for a marathon trainer.

As you master the art of showing up – whether it's sitting at your designated workspace at 5 am sharp, or even just preparing your morning coffee without checking emails first – the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance. By following the same creative ritual, such as reviewing your visualization board before diving into code or scripting your next YouTube segment, you make it easier for the essence of your work to flow. By developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night, ensuring you're rested and ready to excel again tomorrow.
ight. You may not be able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.

And if you know it's a mental trick, why would you fall for it?

Your habit can only last one hundred and twenty seconds.

One of my readers used this strategy to lose over one hundred pounds. In the beginning, he went to the gym each day, but he told himself he wasn't allowed to stay for more than five minutes. He would go to the gym, exercise for five minutes, and leave as soon as his time was up. After a few weeks, he looked around and thought, "Well, I'm always coming here anyway. I might as well start staying a little longer." A few years later, the weight was gone.

Journaling provides another example. Nearly everyone can benefit from getting their thoughts out of their head and onto paper, but most people give up after a few days or avoid it entirely because journaling feels like a chore. The secret is to always stay below the point where it feels like work. Greg McKeown, a leadership consultant from the United Kingdom, built a daily

- - -

- Journaling habit by specifically writing less than he felt like. He always stopped journaling before it seemed like a hassle. Ernest Hemingway believed in similar advice for any kind of writing. “The best way is to always stop when you are going good,” he said.

Strategies like this work for another reason, too: they reinforce the identity you want to build. If you show up at the gym five days in a row—even if it’s just for two minutes—you are casting votes for your new identity. You’re not worried about getting in shape. You’re focused on becoming the type of person who doesn’t miss workouts.

At some point, once you’ve established the habit and you’re showing up each day, you can combine the Two-Minute Rule with a technique we call habit shaping to scale your habit back up toward your ultimate goal. Start by mastering the first two minutes of the smallest version of the
### EXAMPLES OF HABIT SHAPING

- Becoming an Early Riser
- Becoming Vegan

# Starting to Exercise

Nearly any larger life goal can be transformed into a two-minute behavior. 

- I want to live a healthy and long life 
  - I need to stay in shape 
    - I need to exercise 
      - I need to change into my workout clothes. 
- I want to have a happy marriage 
  - I need to be a good partner 
    - I should do something each day to make my partner Anastasiia’s life easier 
      - I should plan a weekly date night.
- I want to wake up refreshed and ready for deep work by 5 am
  - I need a consistent and early bedtime
    - I must establish a relaxing evening routine
      - I will set an alarm for winding down at 7:30 pm.

Whenever you are struggling to stick with a habit, you can employ the Two-Minute Rule. It’s a simple way to make your habits easy.

## Chapter Summary

## How to Make Good Habits Inevitable and Bad Habits Impossible

I. In the summer of 1830, Victor Hugo was facing an impossible deadline. Twelve months earlier, the French author had promised his publisher a new book. But instead of writing, he spent that year pursuing other projects, entertaining guests, and delaying his work. Frustrated, Hugo’s publisher responded by setting a deadline less than six months away. The book had to be finished by February 1831.

Hugo concocted a strange plan to beat his procrastination. He collected all of his clothes and asked an assistant to lock them away in a large chest. He was left with nothing to wear except a large shawl. Lacking any suitable clothing to go outdoors, he remained in his study and wrote furiously during the fall and winter of 1830. *The Hunchback of Notre Dame* was published two weeks early on January 14, 1831.

Sometimes success is less about making good habits easy and more about making bad habits hard. This is an inversion of the principle often applied in your own life, such as turning off your phone to avoid social media distractions while working.
### 3rd Law of Behavior Change - Make it Difficult

If you find yourself continually struggling to follow through on your plans, as is the case with your frequent social media distractions or your inconsistent wake-up routine, then you can benefit from implementing what psychologists call a commitment device.

A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that controls your actions in the future. It's a way to lock in future behavior, bind you to good habits, and restrict you from bad ones. For example, Victor Hugo famously locked away his clothes to focus on writing. You, too, can employ similar strategies to enhance focus and minimize distractions in your environment, particularly when building your AI projects or creating content for social media.

There are many ways to implement commitment devices tailored to your specific challenges. Consider managing food intake by investing in pre-packaged meals which align with your dietary goals, similar to buying food in individual packages rather than in bulk size. To control social media usage, you can utilize app blockers, or set specific offline hours as commitment devices, in this way echoing the strategy of Nir Eyal who used an outlet timer to automatically turn off his internet router at a predetermined time every night to encourage going to bed. 

Another personal example could be setting strict office hours during which your girlfriend knows you are not to be disturbed, thereby safeguarding your deep work sessions. This sets a physical and psychological boundary, functioning as a commitment device for both you and those in your household.

Commitment devices are essential because they help you capitalize on your good intentions before succumbing to temptation. For instance, wanting to wake up at 5 am consistently could be bolstered by committing to an accountability buddy with whom you check in every morning upon waking. This peer pressure is a powerful motivator and keeps you aligned with your goals.

Remember, the key is to modify your tasks in such a way that it becomes more troublesome to break a good habit than to continue with it. For example, if you're feeling motivated to get in shape, sign up and prepay for specific fitness classes or competitions like HYROX, which you enjoy. This way, your commitment is financially and socially binding.

Focus on setting these systems in areas where you notice frequent failures in adherence to your desired habits. By doing so, you align closer with the identity you wish to embody: a disciplined, focused entrepreneur deeply in love with his craft, managing time wisely, and nurturing significant relationships while building a groundbreaking AI solution.
### HOW TO AUTOMATE A HABIT AND NEVER THINK ABOUT IT AGAIN

John Henry Patterson was born in Dayton, Ohio, in 1844. He spent his childhood doing chores on the family farm and working shifts at his father’s sawmill. After attending college at Dartmouth, Patterson returned to Ohio and opened a small supply store for coal miners.

It seemed like a good opportunity. The store faced little competition and enjoyed a steady stream of customers, but still struggled to make money. That was when Patterson discovered his employees were stealing from him.

In the mid-1800s, employee theft was a common problem. Receipts were kept in an open drawer and could easily be altered or discarded. There were no video cameras to review behavior and no software to track transactions. Unless you were willing to hover over your employees every minute of the day, or to manage all transactions yourself, it was difficult to prevent theft.

As Patterson mulled over his predicament, he came across an advertisement for a new invention called Ritty’s Incorruptible Cashier. Designed by fellow Dayton resident James Ritty, it was the first cash register. The machine automatically locked the cash and receipts inside after each transaction.

Patterson bought two for fifty dollars each.

Employee theft at his store vanished overnight. In the next six months, Patterson’s business went from losing money to making $5,000 in profit—the equivalent of more than $100,000 today.

Patterson was so impressed with the machine that he changed businesses. He bought the rights to Ritty’s invention and opened the National Cash Register.

Much like Patterson, you can benefit from automation to ensure consistent execution of habits while minimizing distraction. Considering your busy schedule and the demands of your work in AI, implementing automated systems for routine tasks could significantly improve your productivity. For instance, using software to schedule and automate social media posts about AI advancements allows you to maintain your online presence while preventing the online activity from eating into your content creation and development time. Similarly, setting up automated reminders to review your visualization/affirmation board could reinstate the positive habit without having to actively remember to do so, thus saving your mental bandwidth for complex cognitive tasks. By incorporating these automated approaches — like Patterson’s use of an innovative cash register to solve his business challenge — you effectively eliminate the opportunity for skipping important, albeit routine, tasks, thereby consistently moving closer to your goals of enhanced expertise and a reduced, more focused workload.
Company. Ten years later, National Cash Register had over one thousand employees and was on its way to becoming one of the most successful businesses of its time.

The best way to break a bad habit is to make it impractical to do. Increase the friction until you don’t even have the option to act. The brilliance of the cash register was that it automated ethical behavior by making stealing practically impossible. Rather than trying to change the employees, it made the preferred behavior automatic.

Some actions—like installing a cash register—pay off again and again. These one-time choices require a little bit of effort up front but create increasing value over time. I’m fascinated by the idea that a single choice can deliver returns again and again, and I surveyed my readers on their favorite one-time actions that lead to better long-term habits. The table on the following page shares some of the most popular answers.

I’d wager that if the average person were to simply do half of the one-time actions on this list—even if they didn’t give another thought to their habits—most would find themselves living a better life a year from now. These one-time actions are a straightforward way to employ the 3rd Law of Behavior Change. They make it easier to sleep well, eat healthy, be productive, save money, and generally live better.

### ONE-TIME ACTIONS THAT LOCK IN GOOD HABITS

- Buy a water filter to clean your drinking water. Given your recent move to Dubai and the importance of staying hydrated in a hot climate, ensuring the best quality drinking water is a quick, effective decision enhancing your productivity and health.
- Use smaller plates to reduce caloric intake. This aligns with your goal of eating clean and not overeating.
- Buy a good mattress. Considering your goal to wake up at 5 am feeling rested, investing in a quality mattress can substantially improve your sleep quality.
- Get blackout curtains. These will help in managing your sleep schedule by blocking out light, crucial for your early bedtime and early rise routine.

### Productivity

- Unsubscribe from emails. This reduces the number of distractions you face, especially crucial since checking emails and social media can often sidetrack your focus.
- Turn off notifications and mute group chats. Perfect for enhancing deep work phases and protecting your time as you mentioned that maintaining work-life boundaries is crucial for you.
- Set your phone to silent. This simple action can help maintain your focus, especially during your early morning deep work sessions.
- Use email filters to clear up your inbox. Streamlining your email management will save time and mental energy, letting you focus more on your AI projects and content creation.

- Delete games and social media apps on your phone. This will help cut down on distractions, making sure you’re only using your phone for essential communications and improving your overall productivity.
- Get a dog. While this might seem unrelated, having a pet can increase physical activity and provide stress relief, which could help balance the intense focus you need for your work.
- Move to a friendly, social neighborhood. This can generally enhance your wellbeing and provide a supportive environment, beneficial for you and Anastasiia as you settle into your new home in Dubai.

## General Health

- Get vaccinated. Ensuring you're protected health-wise allows you to focus on your ambitious goals without unexpected health interruptions.
- Buy good shoes to avoid back pain. Investing in quality footwear can support your back during your daily workouts, enhancing performance and comfort.
- Buy a supportive chair or standing desk. Given your extensive periods of work, proper ergonomic support can prevent long-term health issues and increase comfort, enhancing productivity and focus.

### Specific Additions for Your Context

- Enroll in an automatic backup service for your computer data, crucial for preserving your work on AI projects.
- Schedule regular deep work blocks in a shared calendar visible to Anastasiia, reinforcing the importance of this time and reducing interruptions.
- Implement a nighttime gadget ban in the bedroom to support your early sleep schedule, crucial for your goal of consistent 5 am wake-ups.
### Other examples include

- Medicine: Prescriptions can be automatically refilled, much like how your workout supplements could be set for auto-delivery to ensure consistency in your health regimen.
- Personal finance: Employees can save for retirement with an automatic wage deduction. In your case, setting up automatic transfers to a savings account dedicated to specific goals like future AI projects or even personal rewards can streamline your financial management.
- Cooking: Meal-delivery services can do your grocery shopping. This can parallel setting up a meal plan delivery to ensure you consume healthy, brain-boosting foods that align with your rigorous daily schedule, keeping your nutrition on track without the hassle.
- Productivity: Social media browsing can be cut off with a website blocker. Use this to restrict access during your prime productivity hours, ensuring you stay focused on your AI development work without the temptation to scroll through Twitter or YouTube.

When you automate as much of your life as possible, you can spend your effort on the tasks machines cannot do yet. Each habit that we hand over to the authority of technology frees up time and energy to pour into the next stage of growth. As mathematician and philosopher Alfred North Whitehead wrote, “Civilization advances by extending the number of operations we can perform without thinking about them.”

Of course, the power of technology can work against us as well. Binge-watching becomes a habit because you have to put more effort into stopping looking at the screen than to continue doing so. Instead of pressing a button to advance to the next episode, Netflix or YouTube will autoplay it for you. All you have to do is keep your eyes open.

Technology creates a level of convenience that enables you to act on your smallest whims and desires. At the mere suggestion of hunger, you can have food delivered to your door in Dubai just as easily as you ordered food in Amsterdam. Similarly, harnessing this convenience for beneficial habits, like scheduling strict "no-phone" periods during your designated deep work times or using an app to block distracting websites while you're creating content, could significantly boost your productivity and focus.
your door. At the slightest hint of boredom, you can get lost in the vast expanse of social media. When the effort required to act on your desires becomes effectively zero, you can find yourself slipping into whatever impulse arises at the moment. The downside of automation is that we can find ourselves jumping from easy task to easy task without making time for more difficult, but ultimately more rewarding, work.

I often find myself gravitating toward social media during any downtime. If I feel bored for just a fraction of a second, I reach for my phone. It’s easy to write off these minor distractions as “just taking a break,” but over time they can accumulate into a serious issue. The constant tug of “just one more minute” can prevent me from doing anything of consequence. (I’m not the only one. The average person spends over two hours per day on social media. What could you do with an extra six hundred hours per year?)

During the year I was writing this book, I experimented with a new time management strategy. Every Monday, my assistant would reset the passwords on all my social media accounts, which logged me out on each device. All week I worked without distraction. On Friday, she would send me the new passwords. I had the entire weekend to enjoy what social media had to offer until Monday morning when she would do it again. (If you don’t have an assistant, team up with a friend or family member and reset each other’s passwords each week.)

One of the biggest surprises was how quickly I adapted. Within the first week of locking myself out of social media, I realized that I didn’t need to check it nearly as often as I had been, and I certainly didn’t need it each day. It had simply been so easy that it had become the default. Once my bad habit became impossible, I discovered that I did actually have the motivation to work on more meaningful tasks. After I removed the mental candy from my environment, it became much easier to eat the healthy stuff.

When working from your home office in Dubai, consider this method to minimize distractions. As a tech entrepreneur developing AI solutions, the necessity to focus without the interference of social media can enhance your productivity. Use your technical skills to set up website blockers that limit your access to social media during your peak working hours, say from the beginning of your workday until 1 pm. This aligns with your goal to maintain work-life boundaries and enhances deep work sessions crucial for your AI projects and content creation. By customizing your tech environment to support your focus, not only do you reinforce the habits that align with your identity as a leading figure in the AI community, but you also set a foundation that encourages continuous learning and high-quality output in your field.
**Chapter Summary**

The inversion of the 3rd Law of Behavior Change is to make it difficult.

A commitment device is a choice you make in the present that locks in better behavior in the future.

The ultimate way to lock in future behavior is to automate your habits.

One-time choices—like buying a better mattress or enrolling in an automatic savings plan—are single actions that automate your future habits and deliver increasing returns over time.

Using technology to automate your habits is the most reliable and effective way to guarantee the right behavior.

### HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT

**The 1st Law: Make It Obvious**

- Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them. For you, this might mean noting your pattern of checking social media when you intend to work on AI content, or identifying the irregularity of your workout times.
- Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].” For example, “I will review my visualization board at 5:30 AM in my cabinet.”
- Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].” This could be, “After I turn off my morning alarm, I will stretch for 10 minutes.”
- Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. Place your AI textbooks and coding resources on your desk in the cabinet to encourage learning and content creation.

**The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive**

- Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. For instance, listen to your favorite AI podcast while jogging, or reward yourself with a session in your favorite wellness activity like the infrared sauna after a substantial work session.
- Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Engage with online communities of tech entrepreneurs or AI specialists, where daily learning and application is the norm.
- Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. This could mean having a special type of coffee before sitting down to tackle your most challenging AI problems.

**The 3rd Law: Make It Easy**

- Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits. Place your workout clothes ready the night before, or have your AI work set up ready to go as soon as you start your day.
- Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier. Organize your work cabinet to be distraction-free, perhaps by having a whiteboard with your daily AI project tasks listed clearly.
- Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact. Decide which tasks can be handled by automation or delegated, allowing you to focus on high-value activities related to AI.
- Use the Two-Minute Rule. When feeling unmotivated, commit to doing a task for just two minutes. Whether it's responding to a message or jotting down a concept for your YouTube content, this often leads to a longer period of engagement once you've started.

Incorporating these specific, relatable elements can help you seamlessly integrate the principles of "Atomic Habits" into your daily routine, enhancing your productivity and personal development as an aspiring tech entrepreneur.
**The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying**

### How To Break A Bad Habit

**Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible**

- Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. For you, this might mean using app blockers to limit your access to social media during work hours, ensuring your phone is not the first thing you reach for in the morning but perhaps placed in a different room while you meditate or review your visualization board.

**Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive**

- Reframe your mindset. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. Consider how staying away from ad-hoc social media checks can enhance your focus and throughput in AI development or content creation. This approach will be instrumental in building the disciplined tech entrepreneur identity you aspire to.

**Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult**

- Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits. For example, logging out of social media accounts so that it takes a few more steps to check them, giving you time to consider whether it's really beneficial.
- Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you. This might be scheduling specific blocks of time for checking social media or emails, effectively creating a structure that supports deep work periods free from distraction.

**Inversion of the 4th Law: Make It Unsatisfying**

- If you engage in a bad habit, have a penalty in place, perhaps donating to a charity for every unplanned social media scroll session. This condition makes the repercussions of deviation from your goals clear and immediately felt, adding a layer of accountability.

**The Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change**

To make a habit stick, it's crucial to make it satisfying. This fundamental principle can be seen even in the transformation of environments as challenging as Karachi's squatter settlements, where basic yet effective changes led to improved public health practices. Let’s apply this principle to your daily routine to make habits satisfying:

- To make your morning wake-up routine more rewarding and establish consistency, immediately follow your early rise with a habit you find pleasurable, such as reviewing your visualization board or having a quiet coffee moment in your living room that looks out at the Dubai skyline, aligning with your aspiration for a calm, structured start to your day.

- In terms of workout consistency, right after your daily exercise, you could treat yourself to one of your favorite wellness activities—like a session in the infrared sauna or a massage. This not only makes the exercise habit more immediately rewarding but also integrates well with your fitness and wellness goals.

- To solidify your content creation habits for YouTube and Twitter around AI, immediately follow your scheduled posting with a mini-session reviewing feedback from followers or sketching out future content ideas, which can be both satisfying and inspiring, reinforcing your identity as an influential tech influencer.

This tailored approach to habit reinforcement should help cultivate the lifestyle and identity you aspire to embody. By making each essential daily habit satisfying, the likelihood of persistence and long-term integration into your routine increases dramatically.
Luby and his team realized that in an environment like the bustling tech industry, where meticulous planning and constant innovation are key, the habitual practice of systematically tackling tasks while minimizing distractions could drastically improve productivity and well-being. Much like the handwashing pilots in Pakistan, consistency in this personal work system is crucial, not just episodic attempts.

That was when they thought of integrating a tactile, positive reinforcement into the work routine similar to Safeguard soap. As a tech entrepreneur familiar with the draw of well-designed interfaces and seamless user experiences, imagine integrating a system that makes the "deep work" state more enjoyable and distinct.

For instance, using a specific, pleasant aroma in your home office could work just like Safeguard soap—it might make entering deep work mode a more pleasurable transition. This sensory cue could signal to your brain that it's time for focused work. Just as the soap's lather and scent increased the residents' adherence to handwashing, a unique light setting or background sound could make the initiation of your work sessions slightly more enticing and, by extension, more habitual.

"In the tech world, transitioning into deep work should not be seen as mere behavior adjustment but as a habit adoption," Luby might suggest in this scenario. "It is a lot easier for individuals like you, working in high-stakes environments, to adopt a routine that provides a strong positive sensory signal—similar to the menthol taste of toothpaste—than it is to adopt a routine that offers no immediate, pleasurable feedback, such as checking and responding to emails intermittently which can disrupt focus."

This approach isn't just about creating a more efficient work environment, but forming a sensory-rich routine that signals to your mind that it's time to shift gears into deep, productive states. This method leverages simple environmental tweaks to foster consistent and fruitful work habits, aligning perfectly with your goal of enhancing focus and reducing distractions.
talked about trying to create a positive handwashing experience.”

Within months, the researchers saw a rapid shift in the health of children in the neighborhood. The rate of diarrhea fell by 52 percent; pneumonia by 48 percent; and impetigo, a bacterial skin infection, by 35 percent.

The long-term effects were even better. “We went back to some of the households in Karachi six years after,” Luby told me. “Over 95 percent of households who had been given the soap for free and encouraged to wash their hands had a handwashing station with soap and water available when our study team visited. We had not given any soap to the intervention group for over five years, but during the trial they had become so habituated to wash their hands, that they had maintained the practice.” It was a powerful example of the fourth and final Law of Behavior Change: make it satisfying.

We are more likely to repeat a behavior when the experience is satisfying. This is entirely logical. Feelings of pleasure—even minor ones like washing your hands with soap that smells nice and lathers well—are signals that tell the brain: “This feels good. Do this again, next time.” Pleasure teaches your brain that a behavior is worth remembering and repeating.

Take the story of your morning routine. As an aspiring tech entrepreneur in Dubai, adjusting to a new environment and needing to optimize your time, shifting your morning routine to start with a satisfying ritual can set a positive tone for the day. Integrating a simple joy like enjoying a cup of coffee while reviewing your visualization/affirmation board—initially part of your routine but neglected recently—can reboot this habit. The refreshing taste of coffee combined with visual reminders of your goals provides immediate reinforcement, making the process satisfying and more likely to be repeated.

Just as Wrigley made chewing gum tasty and fun, you can make your essential daily tasks more appealing. For example, syncing your AI project development or content production with a personal treat afterwards, like a session in an infrared sauna or a special time with Anastasiia, can make these crucial but challenging tasks more satisfying. This approach ties the hard work directly to a pleasurable outcome, strengthening your habit loop.

In your case, immediate rewards after completing daunting tasks—whether coding a new AI feature or producing high-quality YouTube content—can make a significant difference. Regular joys embedded in your schedule train your brain to form positive associations with these tasks, thus reinforcing your habits and aligning them with your vision of becoming a legendary tech entrepreneur with a robust online presence and groundbreaking AI innovations.
- Toothpaste had a similar trajectory. Manufacturers enjoyed great success when they added flavors like spearmint, peppermint, and cinnamon to their products. These flavors don’t improve the effectiveness of toothpaste. They simply create a “clean mouth” feel and make the experience of brushing your teeth more pleasurable. My wife actually stopped using Sensodyne because she didn't like the aftertaste. She switched to a brand with a stronger mint flavor, which proved to be more satisfying.

Similarly, in your life, the satisfaction you seek from forming habits can be akin to finding the right toothpaste flavor. Considering your experience with needing to find gratification in social media interactions, think about substituting scrolling on Instagram or Twitter with a brief session of engaging directly with your followers on these platforms. This small switch could give you a more satisfying "clean mouth feel" of social interaction without the unsavory aftertaste of lost time and distraction.

- Conversely, if an experience is not satisfying, we have little reason to repeat it. In my research, I came across the story of a woman who had a narcissistic relative who drove her nuts. In an attempt to spend less time with this egomaniac, she acted as dull and as boring as possible whenever he was around. Within a few encounters, he started avoiding her because he found her so uninteresting.

Imagine applying this principle to your tasks that you find overwhelming or mundane. You might consider batching similar low-priority tasks and setting a timer to work through them quickly and efficiently. This limits exposure to the "narcissistic relative" of tasks and keeps your day flowing more pleasantly.

- Stories like these are evidence of the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is rewarded is repeated. What is punished is avoided. You learn what to do in the future based on what you were rewarded for doing (or punished for doing) in the past. Positive emotions cultivate habits. Negative emotions destroy them.

For you, the reward of completing a focused session of work on your AI projects without interruptions can be as satisfying as a good work out, aligning positive feelings with your goals. The punishment, such as fatigue from a sleepless night due to late work sessions, teaches you the importance of adhering to your desired bedtime.

- The first three laws of behavior change—make it obvious, make it attractive, and make it easy—increase the odds that a behavior will be performed this time.

Applying this to your desire to wake early at 5 AM, make it obvious by placing multiple alarms away from your bed, make it attractive by rewarding yourself with a quiet, unhurried breakfast or a morning walk, and make it easy by preparing your morning essentials the night before.

- The fourth law of behavior change—make it satisfying—increases the odds that a behavior will be repeated next time. It completes the habit loop.

To make gym workouts consistently satisfying, consider aligning it with a reward that boosts your entrepreneurial spirit, like listening to a new business audiobook or a podcast about AI while exercising. This not only makes the routine enjoyable but also reinforces your identity as a tech entrepreneur deeply engaged in learning and personal growth.

- But there is a trick. We are not looking for just any type of satisfaction. We are looking for immediate satisfaction.

To transform social media use from a distraction into a productive tool for your branding, immediately engage with users who comment on your posts or share your content. This direct interaction not only satisfies your need for social connection but also enhances your brand's presence, making the activity immediately gratifying and aligned with your long-term goals.
- The decisions you make today will not benefit you immediately. If you do a good job at work, you'll get a paycheck in a few weeks. If you exercise today, perhaps you won't be overweight next year. If you save money now, maybe you'll have enough for retirement decades from now. You live in what scientists call a delayed-return environment because you can work for years before your actions deliver the intended payoff.

For instance, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur developing a new AI solution, the coding and concept work you do today might not result in a usable product or profitable business for months or even years. Similarly, your effort to grow your personal brand by regularly posting AI-related content on Twitter and YouTube won't immediately net you millions of followers or a substantial online influence. This is the essence of operating within a delayed-return environment, where the fruits of your labor are not instant, but require perseverance and sustained effort.

- The human brain did not evolve for life in a delayed-return environment. The earliest remains of modern humans, known as Homo sapiens sapiens, are approximately two hundred thousand years old. These were the first humans to have a brain relatively similar to ours. In particular, the neocortex—the newest part of the brain and the region responsible for higher functions like language—was roughly the same size two hundred thousand years ago as today. You are walking around with the same hardware as your Paleolithic ancestors.

This part of your brain can make it challenging to maintain the discipline to wake up at 5 am consistently or stick to an early bedtime when immediate rewards (like scrolling through social media or staying up late with Anastasiia) often seem more appealing. The temptation of immediate gratification, as experienced by our ancestors when securing a meal, is paralleled in modern times by the instant pleasure of digital interaction.

- It is only recently—during the last five hundred years or so—that society has shifted to a predominantly delayed-return environment. Compared to the age of the brain, modern society is brand-new. In the last one hundred years, we have seen the rise of the car, the airplane, the television, the personal computer, the internet, the smartphone, and Beyoncé. The world has changed much in recent years, but human nature has changed little.

Just as the world has rapidly transitioned, your life in moving from Amsterdam to Dubai is a microcosm of adapting to new environments. Though your surroundings and routines have changed—navigating a new city, setting up a home office space, adjusting to different social norms—your basic needs and the way your brain functions remain the same. This transition emphasizes how you, like society, must manage the delay in returns, whether it's adapting to a new city or building a new business.

- Similar to other animals on the African savannah, our ancestors spent their days responding to grave threats, securing the next meal, and taking shelter from a storm. It made sense to place a high value on instant gratification. The distant future was less of a concern. And after thousands of generations in an immediate-return environment, your daily routines and the struggles—in managing distractions, maintaining discipline in personal habits, and working efficiently from home—illustrate the ongoing challenge of balancing immediate needs with long-term goals. 

Comprehending this can help you adjust your strategies, perhaps by revisiting the use of your visualisation/affirmation board or establishing more rigid boundaries with Anastasiia regarding work-life separation, which allows a clearer focus on long-term aspirations like becoming a leading tech entrepreneur and a thought leader in the AI space.
environment, our brains evolved to prefer quick payoffs to long-term ones.

- Behavioral economists refer to this tendency as time inconsistency. That is, the way your brain evaluates rewards is inconsistent across time. You value the present more than the future. Usually, this tendency serves us well. A reward that is certain right now is typically worth more than one that is merely possible in the future. But occasionally, our bias toward instant gratification causes problems.

- Why would someone smoke if they know it increases the risk of lung cancer? Why would someone overeat when they know it increases their risk of obesity? Why would someone have unsafe sex if they know it can result in sexually transmitted disease? Once you understand how the brain prioritizes rewards, the answers become clear: the consequences of bad habits are delayed while the rewards are immediate. For example, scrolling through social media might feel satisfying now, but it distracts from your goal to create engaging AI content, leading to stress and reduced productivity later. Similarly, hitting the snooze button gives immediate comfort but disrupts your aspiration to wake consistently at 5 am, impacting your planned morning deep work session.

Every habit produces multiple outcomes across time. Unfortunately, these outcomes are often misaligned. With our bad habits, the immediate outcome usually feels good, but the ultimate outcome feels bad. With good habits, it is the reverse: the immediate outcome is unenjoyable, but the ultimate outcome feels good. The French economist Frédéric Bastiat explained the problem clearly when he wrote, “It almost always happens that when the immediate consequence is favorable, the later consequences are disastrous, and vice versa. . . . Often, the sweeter the first fruit of a habit, the more bitter are its later fruits.”

Put another way, the costs of your good habits are in the present. The costs of your bad habits are in the future. For instance, preparing and cleaning up after a healthy meal might seem cumbersome now, but it contributes to your long-term health and aligns with your identity as someone who values longevity and wellness.

The brain’s tendency to prioritize the present moment means you can’t rely on good intentions alone. For example, despite your understanding of the value of deep work, the immediate lure of a quick email check can overshadow the long-term benefits of sustained focus. By structuring your environment to minimize distractions—such as turning off notifications and scheduling specific check-in times for email—you leverage your surroundings to support your long-term goals, aligning your immediate actions with your ultimate aspirations.
With a fuller understanding of what causes our brain to repeat some behaviors and avoid others, let's update the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change: What is immediately rewarded is repeated. What is immediately punished is avoided.

Our preference for instant gratification reveals an important truth about success: because of how we are wired, most people will spend all day chasing quick hits of satisfaction. The road less traveled is the road of delayed gratification. If you’re willing to wait for the rewards, you’ll face less competition and often get a bigger payoff. As the saying goes, the last mile is always the least crowded.

This is precisely what research has shown. People who are better at delaying gratification have higher SAT scores, lower levels of substance abuse, lower likelihood of obesity, better responses to stress, and superior social skills. We’ve all seen this play out in our own lives. If you delay watching television and get your homework done, you'll generally learn more and get better grades. If you don’t buy desserts and chips at the store, you’ll often eat healthier food when you get home. At some point, success in nearly every field requires you to ignore an immediate reward in favor of a delayed reward.

Here’s the problem: most people know that delaying gratification is the wise approach. They want the benefits of good habits: to be healthy, productive, at peace. But these outcomes are seldom top-of-mind at the decisive moment.

Take your daily routine, for instance. You aspire to wake up at 5 am every day to optimize productivity and align with your vision of becoming a renowned tech entrepreneur. The challenge emerges when the immediate comfort of a warm bed at 5 am is much more appealing than the act of rising. Rewarding yourself with a structured morning routine that includes reviewing your visualization board can tilt the balance. It turns the act of waking early into an immediately rewarding experience, reinforcing your entrepreneurial identity.

Similarly, consider your transition to using AI in solving real-world problems effectively—tasks that demand deep work and immense focus. The satisfaction of scrolling through social media or answering non-priority emails can often overshadow the delayed gratification of developing a robust AI model or producing high-quality content. To counteract this, you might reframe your perspective to view each focused work session as a foundational step towards your ultimate goal of being a leader in the AI space. Perhaps tagging a mini-reward, like a brief walk or a session of stretching post a deep work session, could provide that immediate satisfaction, ensuring the habit of focused work is not just maintained but cherished.

With these adaptations, the Cardinal Rule of Behavior Change becomes not just a theory but a practical, impactful toolkit in your everyday quest to mold your ideal future self. By aligning immediate rewards with your long-term aspirations, the bridge between present actions and future outcomes not only strengthens but also becomes a source of satisfaction and motivation.
### HOW TO TURN INSTANT GRATIFICATION TO YOUR ADVANTAGE

- **The vital thing in getting a habit to stick is to feel successful—even if it's in a small way.** The feeling of success is a signal that your habit paid off and that the work was worth the effort. For you, this might mean setting a small daily goal related to your AI projects, such as solving a particular coding problem or completing a specific module in your learning. Each time you accomplish these tasks, you reinforce your identity as a capable and effective tech entrepreneur.

- **In a perfect world, the reward for a good habit is the habit itself. In the real world, good habits tend to feel worthwhile only after they have provided you with something.** Early on, it’s all sacrifice. You’ve gone to the gym a few times, but you're not stronger or fitter or faster—at least, not in any noticeable sense. It’s only months later, once you've shed a few pounds or your arms gain some definition, that it becomes easier to exercise for its own sake. In your case, this could be likened to your struggle with waking up at 5 AM. Initially, it may be challenging and the benefits not immediately visible, but as you persist, the quality and productivity of your mornings could lead to a more successful day, serving as their own reward.

- **What we’re really talking about here—when we’re discussing immediate rewards—is the ending of a behavior.** The ending of any experience is vital because we tend to remember it more than other phases. You want the ending of your habit to be satisfying. For instance, after a particularly focused work session on building your AI solution, reward yourself with a small, enjoyable activity that doesn’t cause distractions, such as a five-minute meditation or a quick walk around your living area. These activities can help you transition smoothly between your intense focus periods and leisure, enhancing recovery and satisfaction.
- Immediate reinforcement can be especially helpful when dealing with habits of avoidance, which are behaviors you want to stop doing. It can be challenging to stick with habits like "no frivolous purchases" or "no alcohol this month" because nothing happens when you skip happy hour drinks or don’t buy that pair of shoes. It can be hard to feel satisfied when there is no action in the first place. All you’re doing is resisting temptation, and there isn’t much satisfying about that.

One solution is to turn the situation on its head. You want to make avoidance visible. Open a savings account and label it for something you want—maybe

- **AI Development Fund:** Whenever you pass on a purchase, put the same amount of money in the account. Skip your morning latte? Transfer $5. Pass on a tech gadget you don’t really need? Move $50 over. It’s like creating a loyalty program for yourself. The immediate reward of seeing yourself save money toward your AI projects feels a lot better than being deprived. You are making it satisfying to focus on your financial priorities.

- One of my readers, a young entrepreneur like yourself, used a similar setup. He wanted to minimize distractions and maximize productive use of his time. He labeled his savings account “Upgrade Workspace.” Whenever he successfully avoided social media during work hours, he transferred $10 into the account. At the end of the month, he used the money to enhance his home office, making it a more inviting and efficient workspace.

- It is worth noting that it is important to select short-term rewards that reinforce your identity rather than ones that conflict with it. Buying new tech gadgets is fine if you’re not trying to budget and save money, but it doesn’t work if you're attempting to funnel resources into your start-up. Instead, rewarding yourself with productivity tools or educational courses aligns with your ultimate goal of becoming a successful tech entrepreneur. Similarly, if your reward for finishing a project phase early is a weekend getaway with Anastasiia, then you’re casting votes for an identity that values not only hard work but also personal relationships and wellbeing.
- Eventually, as intrinsic rewards like a better mood, more energy, and reduced stress kick in, you’ll become less concerned with chasing the secondary reward. The identity itself becomes the reinforcer. You do it because it’s who you are and it feels good to be you. The more a habit becomes part of your life, the less you need outside encouragement to follow through. Incentives can start a habit. Identity sustains a habit.

    For example, let’s look at your goal to consistently wake up at 5 am. The immediate reward might be the serene morning hours you get to spend diving into your AI projects without distractions. Over time, this consistent early rising reinforces your identity not just as an early riser, but as a disciplined, focused AI expert who makes the most of productive morning hours. 

- That said, it takes time for the evidence to accumulate and a new identity to emerge. Immediate reinforcement helps maintain motivation in the short term while you’re waiting for the long-term rewards to arrive.

    Consider your enjoyment of workout sessions tied with wellness treatments like massages and ice baths. Initially, these wellness activities serve as immediate reinforcements, making the habit of regular exercise more enjoyable and helping you maintain momentum until the intrinsic benefits of fitness, like higher energy levels and better health, become more noticeable.

- In summary, a habit needs to be enjoyable for it to last. Simple bits of reinforcement—like using your love for high-quality coffee as a reward for a focused work session or the satisfaction of ticking off tasks on your digital task manager—can offer the immediate pleasure you need to maintain motivation in your habits. And remember, change is easy when it is enjoyable.

## How to Stick with Good Habits Every Day

    Implementing these principles daily, like creating strict guidelines around responding to messages only certain times of the day, leverages the Fourth Law to reduce the overwhelming feeling of constant communication. By batching and scheduling this task, it becomes more manageable and limits distraction, allowing you to focus deeply on your important AI projects. This method not only makes your day more satisfying and streamlined but also fortifies your identity as a focused and efficient entrepreneur.
-old stockbroker named Trent Dyrsmid. Abbotsford was a relatively small suburb, tucked away in the shadow of nearby Vancouver, where most of the big business deals were being made. Given the location, and the fact that Dyrsmid was a rookie, nobody expected too much of him. But he made brisk progress thanks to a simple daily habit.

Dyrsmid began each morning with two jars on his desk. One was filled with 120 paper clips. The other was empty. As soon as he settled in each day, he would make a sales call. Immediately after, he would move one paper clip from the full jar to the empty jar and the process would begin again. “Every morning I would start with 120 paper clips in one jar and I would keep dialing the phone until I had moved them all to the second jar,” he told me.

Within eighteen months, Dyrsmid was bringing in $5 million to the firm. By age twenty-four, he was making $75,000 per year—the equivalent of $125,000 today. Not long after, he landed a six-figure job with another company.

2. Inspired by this story, you might start a similar system where for every deep work session completed in your home office focusing on AI development, you move a marble from one jar to another. This simple act would materially visualize progress and maintain focus through this tangible form of measurement, crucial especially on days where digital distractions beckon.

## As a result,

they reinforce your behavior and add a little bit of immediate satisfaction to any activity. Visual measurement comes in many forms: food journals, workout logs, loyalty punch cards, the progress bar on a software download, even the page numbers in a book. But perhaps the best way to measure your progress is with a habit tracker.

# HOW TO KEEP YOUR HABITS ON TRACK

A habit tracker is a simple way to measure whether you did a habit. For example, if you meditate on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, each of those dates gets an X. As time rolls by, the calendar becomes a record of your habit streak.

Countless people have tracked their habits, but perhaps the most famous was Benjamin Franklin. Beginning at age twenty, Franklin carried a small booklet everywhere he went and used it to track his adherence to thirteen personal virtues. This practice of reflection not only helped him feel more in control but also assisted in sustaining effort over long periods.

Imagine creating a similar habit tracker for your early wake-up goals, marking an X for every day you manage to get up at 5 am. This visual cue not only motivates you to keep the streak going but also provides clear data to reflect on during less disciplined weeks. By combining the historical tracking of Franklin with the immediate visual feedback of paper clips, like Dyrsmid, you create a powerful tool for ensuring day-to-day progress towards becoming the legendary tech maestro you aspire to be.
Jerry Seinfeld reportedly uses a habit tracker to stick with his streak of writing jokes. In the documentary Comedian, he explains that his goal is simply to "never break the chain" of writing jokes every day. In other words, he is not focused on how good or bad a particular joke is or how inspired he feels. He is simply focused on showing up and adding to his streak.

Don’t break the chain of sales calls, and you’ll build a successful book of business. Don’t break the chain of workouts, and you’ll get fit faster than you’d expect. In your case, maintaining a daily chain of development work on your AI projects or consistent content creation for your YouTube and Twitter platforms—much like Seinfeld’s approach to writing jokes—can significantly propel your status as a tech entrepreneur. Each day you engage deeply in these initiatives, you're adding a link to a chain of expertise and online presence, which is crucial in the competitive tech space.

## Benefit #1: Habit tracking is obvious.

Habit tracking naturally builds a series of visual cues like the streak of X’s on your calendar or the list of video edits completed in your project log. When you look at the calendar and see your streak, you’ll be reminded to act again. Research has shown that people who track their progress on goals like losing weight, quitting smoking, and lowering blood pressure are all more likely to improve than those who don’t.

One study of more than sixteen hundred people found that those who kept a daily food log lost twice as much weight as those who did not. The mere act of tracking a behavior can spark the urge to change it. Similarly, by regularly updating a log of your daily AI tasks or content creation efforts, you could more clearly see patterns or gaps in your productivity, helping refine your approach and escalating progress.

Habit tracking also keeps you honest. Most of us have a distorted view of our own behavior. We think we act better than we do. Measurement offers one way

To overcome our blindness to our own behavior and notice what’s really going on each day. One glance at the written confirmations of your system upgrades or coding hours, and you immediately know how much work you have (or haven’t) been putting in. When the evidence—like your completion of learning modules or model optimizations—is right in front of you, you’re less likely to lie to yourself.
### Benefit #1: Habit tracking is motivating.
Habit tracking creates a constant reminder of what you need to accomplish, serving as a prompt within your environment. For example, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur trying to solidify your schedule for waking up at 5 am, seeing a streak of early mornings logged can push you to maintain this habit, reinforcing your identity as someone disciplined in their personal and professional life.

### Benefit #2: Habit tracking is attractive.
Visual tracking charts or apps could be used as motivational tools to keep you engaged in daily content creation for your AI projects and posting on social media. The graphical representation of your consistency can make the process more attractive, transforming it from a chore to a visually rewarding experience.

### Benefit #3: Habit tracking is satisfying.

This is the most crucial benefit of all. Tracking can become its own form of reward. It feels good to watch your results grow—like the increasing number of your YouTube subscribers or the growing list of AI projects you've completed. If it feels good, then you’re more likely to persist. For you, habit tracking transforms the tedious task of content creation into a measurable progress chart toward becoming a recognized AI expert and influencer.

Furthermore, habit tracking provides visual proof that you are casting votes for the type of person you wish to become, offering immediate and intrinsic gratification while embodying your goals of disciplined entrepreneurship and leadership in the AI space.

You may be wondering, if habit tracking is so useful, why have I waited so long to talk about it?

### Despite all the benefits, I’ve left this discussion until now for a simple reason: many people resist the idea of tracking and measuring. It can feel like a burden.

Because it forces you into two habits: the habit you’re trying to build and the habit of tracking it. For someone like you, managing a busy schedule and maintaining relationships, adding another task – like recording every meal for your healthy diet or tracking every minute of deep work – might seem daunting. It feels easier to say, “I’ll just stick to my plans.” Or, “I’ll try harder.” Or, “I’ll remember to do it.” You might tell yourself, "I know I need to post daily on social media," but actually logging each post and its impact could at first seem like a stretch.

What can we do to make tracking easier?

- First, whenever possible, measurement should be automated. Utilize apps that can integrate with your lifestyle, like a fitness tracker that automatically records your workouts or social media tools that schedule and analyze post engagements for your AI content. This minimizes the manual effort and fits seamlessly into your busy life, helping you maintain your focus on primary tasks without losing track of other important, habit-forming activities.
- Second, manual tracking should be limited to your most important habits. It is better to consistently track one habit than to sporadically track ten.

- Finally, record each measurement immediately after the habit occurs. The completion of the behavior is the cue to write it down. This approach allows you to combine the habit-stacking method mentioned in Chapter 5 with habit tracking.

    - After I hang up the phone from a sales call, I will move one paper clip over.
    
    - After I finish each set at the gym, I will record it in my workout journal.
    
    - After I put my plate in the dishwasher, I will write down what I ate.

These tactics can make tracking your habits easier. Even if you aren’t the type of person who enjoys recording your behavior, I think you’ll find a few weeks of measurements to be insightful. It’s always interesting to see how you’ve actually

- been spending your time.
   
That said, every habit streak ends at some point. And, more important than any single measurement, is having a good plan for when your habits slide off track.

# How To Recover Quickly When Your Habits Break Down

Before long, an emergency will pop up—you get sick or you have to travel for work or your family needs a little more of your time.

Whenever this happens to me, I try to remind myself of a simple rule: 
Maybe I’ll eat an entire pizza, but I’ll follow it up with a healthy meal. I can’t be perfect, but I can avoid a second lapse. As soon as one streak ends, I get started on the next one. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work.

I think this principle is so important that I’ll stick to it even if I can’t do a habit as well or as consistently as usual. For example, if you find that a sudden deadline disrupts your early morning AI work, don't let this derail your entire routine. Perhaps you can shorten the session instead of skipping it entirely, ensuring you maintain engagement with your core focus areas. Likewise, if your move to Dubai temporarily disrupts your workout schedule, commit to even a minimal set of stretches or a quick jog to keep the habit alive, adapting to maintain the pace of your ambitious tech and personal goals.
### KNOWING WHEN (AND WHEN NOT) TO TRACK A HABIT

Say you're running an AI-focused tech startup and you want to ensure your productivity in content creation and technical project development is optimal. One way to measure success is to track how many hours you dedicate to these tasks each day. If you're spending more hours, it might seem like you're productive. However, this one measurement—daily dedicated hours—only gives a limited picture of what’s really going on. Just because you're sitting at your desk longer doesn't mean you're producing high-quality work or effectively advancing your projects. Especially considering your challenge of dealing with distractions and the tendency to scroll through social media.

Similarly, tracking your early rising habit by just counting the days you wake up at 5 am might miss the point. It's crucial to assess the quality of your morning routine and its impact on your productivity throughout the day. Are these mornings when you manage to wake up early leading to more focused and uninterrupted work time? Or are they just a checkmark on your routine that doesn't translate into real productivity?

In your case, it’s vital to track habits that lead directly to high-quality output and personal satisfaction, rather than just completing tasks. For example, instead of merely tracking the number of AI projects completed, focus on the impact or the innovation level of each project. This shifts your measurement from quantity to quality—a more relevant metric for your goal to become a renowned tech entrepreneur.

Furthermore, consider your physical fitness regimen. Rather than tracking just the days you work out, assess how each session contributes to your overall physical health and how it aligns with your goal to maintain a peak athletic condition. This will help in avoiding the all-or-nothing approach where you might feel compelled to push through even when your body needs rest, by prioritizing recovery and the quality of each workout session.

Tracking the right aspects of your habits, and adjusting them to align closely with your ultimate goals, will not only enhance your productivity but also ensure that your daily activities contribute meaningfully towards becoming the visionary leader you aspire to be.
### Measurement and Reflection: Guiding Your AI Entrepreneurship Journey Efficiently 

Instead, it may be more effective to track how many customers your AI solutions are reaching or perhaps the impact level of your AI innovations in real-world scenarios.

If your success is measured by the number of valuable AI algorithms you develop, you will optimize innovation, code quality, and practical application over mere entity counts or generic output. If your success is measured by the effectiveness of your YouTube tutorials, you might focus on viewer engagement and actionable feedback rather than solely on subscriber counts.

This pitfall is evident in many areas of life, including the tech industry. We focus on coding for long hours instead of getting meaningful projects completed, similar to your struggle with maintaining a disciplined schedule at home despite living in a vibrant city like Dubai.

This is sometimes referred to as Goodhart’s Law. Named after the economist Charles Goodhart, the principle states:

> "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

Re Measurement is only useful when it guides you and adds context to a larger picture, not when it dominates your efforts. Each number is simply one piece of feedback in the overall system.

In our data-driven world, especially in fields like deep learning and quantitative trading that you've experienced, we tend to overvalue numbers and undervalue qualitative outcomes, soft skills, and difficult-to-quantify personal achievements. We mistakenly think the factors we can measure are the only factors that exist. But just because you can measure something doesn’t mean it’s the most important thing. And just because you can’t measure something doesn’t mean it’s not important at all.

All of this to say, it’s crucial to keep habit tracking in its proper place in the tech entrepreneur's toolkit. It can feel satisfying to record a habit like "coding without distractions for three hours" or "creating one AI-based content piece daily" and track your progress, but the measurement is not the only thing that matters. Furthermore, there are many ways to measure progress, and sometimes it helps to shift your focus to something entirely different, like your personal well-being or the satisfaction of solving real-world problems with AI, which might not be immediately quantifiable.

This is why nonscale victories can be effective for personal growth beyond your career. While your focus might be on developing advanced AI solutions or crafting influential content, equally important could be the improvements in your personal discipline, such as consistently waking up at 5 am, and your relationship management, both of which form the bedrock of your work but may not have direct numerical measures. Remember, in your journey as an AI entrepreneur, not everything that counts can be counted.

### How an Accountability Partner Can Change Everything

After serving as a Pilot in World War II, Roger Fisher attended Harvard Law School and spent thirty-four years specializing in negotiation and conflict management. He founded the Harvard Negotiation Project and worked with numerous countries and world leaders on peace resolutions, hostage crises, and diplomatic compromises. But it was in the 1970s and 1980s, as the threat of nuclear war escalated, that Fisher developed perhaps his most interesting idea.

At the time, Fisher was focused on designing strategies that could prevent nuclear war, and he had noticed a troubling fact. Any sitting president would have access to launch codes that could kill millions of people but would never actually see anyone die because he would always be thousands of miles away.

“My suggestion was quite simple,” he wrote in 1981. “Put that [nuclear] code number in a little capsule, and then implant that capsule right next to the heart of a volunteer. The volunteer would carry with him a big, heavy butcher knife as he accompanied the President. If ever the President wanted to fire nuclear weapons, the only way he could do so would be for him first, with his own hands, to kill one human being. The President says, ‘George, I’m sorry but tens of millions must die.’ He has to look at someone and realize what death is—what an innocent death is. Blood on the White House carpet. It’s reality brought home.

“When I suggested this to friends in the Pentagon they said, ‘My God, that’s terrible. Having to kill someone would distort the President’s judgment. He might never push the button.’”

Throughout our discussion of the 4th Law of Behavior Change we have covered the importance of making good habits satisfying. For you, this call to action could mean setting up a system where each major milestone in your AI projects or content creation gets immediately recognized and rewarded. Given your background in deep learning and quantitative analysis, you could create a feedback loop where AI algorithms measure the success of your posts or developments in real-time, providing not only data-driven insights but also immediate satisfaction.

For instance, if you're working on growing your personal brand on social media platforms like Twitter and YouTube, consider setting up instant notifications for positive engagements which could serve as small wins keeping you motivated. Additionally, co-founding an accountability group with fellow content creators can leverage communal reinforcement, much like Roger Fisher's associative strategy of having a volunteer physically embody the consequences of a drastic action. This shared responsibility and visibility can drastically increase your commitment to regular and meaningful posting, shaping a robust online presence that reflects your deep-tech expertise and unique entrepreneurial journey.

In Dubai’s dynamic tech scene, grounding significant work decisions in such vivid, personal interactions could dramatically enhance your effectiveness—mirroring the intensified decision-making Fisher envisioned. Establish this pattern of accountability as you explore AI solutions, ensuring that each step forwards is not only technically sound but also personally rewarding, strengthening your resolve to become a legendary tech maestro.
## Make It Immediately Satisfying

Fisher's proposal is an inversion of the 4th Law:

- Just as we are more likely to repeat an experience when the ending is satisfying, we are also more likely to avoid an experience when the ending is unsatisfying.

- **Pain is an effective teacher.** If a failure is painful, it gets fixed. If a failure is relatively painless, it gets ignored. The more immediate and more costly a mistake is, the faster you will learn from it. The threat of a bad review forces a plumber to be good at his job. The possibility of a customer never returning makes restaurants create good food. The cost of cutting the wrong blood vessel makes a surgeon master human anatomy and cut carefully. When the consequences are severe, people learn quickly. Similarly, for you as a tech entrepreneur and content creator, the pain of missing a posted video deadline or receiving critical user feedback can drive improvements and future punctuality in your schedule.

- **The more immediate the pain, the less likely the behavior.** If you want to prevent bad habits and eliminate unhealthy behaviors, then adding an instant cost to the action is a great way to reduce their odds. For instance, as someone who is easily distracted by social media while working, you might set an app blocker with a strict schedule which only allows social media access during designated times, thereby creating an immediate barrier to this distraction.

- **We repeat bad habits because they serve us in some way, and that makes them hard to abandon.** The best way I know to overcome this predicament is to increase the speed of the punishment associated with the behavior. There can't be a gap between the action and the consequences. For instance, if procrastinating on replying to important emails is a bad habit, setting an auto-notification that reminds you of emails pending for over 24 hours can introduce an immediate sense of urgency.

- **As soon as actions incur an immediate consequence, behavior begins to change.** Customers pay their bills on time when they are charged a late fee. Students show up to class when their grade is linked to attendance. Similarly, you can implement an immediate consequence for not achieving your daily goals. For instance, not allowing yourself to relax with a night-time movie if the day's main AI project or content creation task isn't completed.

- **There is, of course, a limit to this.** If you're going to rely on punishment to change behavior, then the strength of the punishment must match the relative strength of the behavior it is trying to correct. To increase productivity, the cost of procrastination must be greater than the cost of action. To maintain your health and fitness as a developed sportsman, the pain of missing a workout must be greater than the ease of relaxing. Implementing a fine paid into a savings for each skipped workout or delayed work task can turn these goals into tangible results. This method takes advantage of your dislike for breaking commitments and financial loss, turning them into a compelling tool to enforce discipline.
### THE HABIT CONTRACT

The first seat belt law was passed in New York on December 1, 1984. At the time, just 14 percent of people in the United States regularly wore a seat belt—but that was all about to change.

Within five years, over half of the nation had seat belt laws. Today, wearing a seat belt is enforceable by law in forty-nine of the fifty states. And it’s not just the legislation, the number of people wearing seat belts has changed dramatically as well. In 2016, over 88 percent of Americans buckled up each time they got in a car. In just over thirty years, there was a complete reversal in the habits of millions of people.

Laws and regulations are an example of how government can change our habits by creating a social contract. As a society, we collectively agree to abide by certain rules and then enforce them as a group. Whenever a new piece of legislation impacts behavior—seat belt laws, banning smoking inside restaurants, mandatory recycling—it is an example of a social contract shaping our habits. The group agrees to act in a certain way, and if you don’t follow along, you’ll be punished.

Just as governments use laws to hold citizens accountable, you can create a habit contract to hold yourself accountable. A habit contract is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don’t follow through. Then you find one or two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.

Imagine applying this to your own habit of waking up at 5 AM daily to maximize productivity and focus for your AI projects and content creation. You might draft a habit contract stating that for every morning you fail to wake up at 5 AM, you'll forfeit a planned leisure activity, such as a wellness procedure you cherish (like a visit to the sauna or a massage session). Enlist Anastasiia or a close colleague as your accountability partner. This contrast between immediate minor consequences (missing a visit to the sauna) and the long-term benefits of sustained morning discipline aligns well with your goals of enhanced productivity and personal discipline. This method leverages immediate cost to enforce your early-morning routine, making it likely that you'll stick to this schedule, crucial for your entrepreneurial success and personal wellbeing.
Chris, an AI entrepreneur from Dubai, originally from Amsterdam, was the first person I saw put this strategy into action. Shortly after moving to a new country, Chris realized he wanted to optimize his daily routine to boost productivity and focus, essential for his ambitious goal of mastering AI and growing his personal brand. He wrote up a habit contract between himself, his girlfriend Anastasiia, and a close mentor from the tech community. The first version read, “Chris’s #1 objective for Q1 of 2023 is to establish a solid morning routine that includes waking up at 5 am and starting his day with AI development or content creation.”

Below that statement, Chris laid out a road map for achieving his ideal outcome:

- Phase #1: Use the first hour of the day for deep work on AI without any distractions - social media and phone off until 1 pm.
- Phase #2: Allocate specific times for routine tasks and social media engagement to streamline productivity and minimize distractions in Q2.
- Phase #3: Consistently engage in recovery activities like ice baths and massages, ensuring effective physical and mental recuperation in Q3.

Finally, he wrote out each of the daily habits that would get him to his goal. For example, “Strictly adhere to the waking up at 5 am and immediately spend one hour on AI development.”

And then he listed the punishment if he failed: “If Chris doesn’t adhere to these commitments, then the following consequence will be enforced: He must donate $200 to a charity of Anastasiia’s choosing for each slip-up. Additionally, missing a morning session means no evening relaxation activities like watching movies or dining out.”

At the bottom of the page, Chris, Anastasiia, and his mentor all signed the contract.

My initial reaction was that a contract like this seemed overly formal and unnecessary, especially the signatures. But Chris convinced me that signing the contract was an indication of seriousness. “Anytime I skip this part,” he said, “my daily efficiency plummets almost immediately.”

Three months later, after hitting his targets for Q1, Chris upgraded his goals. The consequences escalated, too. If he indulged in social media during his deep work hours, he had to pay his mentor $100 for each infraction. And if he failed to wake up at 5 am, he had to offer a personal, creative apology to Anastasiia, often involving making her a special breakfast or planning a unique date night—something he found equally challenging yet rewarding. This not only reinforced his commitment but also strengthened their relationship, aligning his personal life with his professional ambitions.

The strategy worked. With his wife and trainer acting as accountability partners and with the habit contract clarifying exactly what to do each day, Harris lost the weight.

To make bad habits unsatisfying, your best option is to make them painful in the moment. Creating a habit contract is a straightforward way to do exactly that. Even if you don’t want to create a full-blown habit contract, simply having an accountability partner is useful. The comedian Margaret Cho writes a joke or song every day. She does the “song a day” challenge with a friend, which helps them both stay accountable. Knowing that someone is watching can be a powerful motivator. You are less likely to procrastinate or give up because there is an immediate cost. If you don’t follow through, perhaps they’ll see you as untrustworthy or lazy. Suddenly, you are not only failing to uphold your promises to yourself, but also failing to uphold your promises to others.

You can even automate this process. Thomas Frank, an entrepreneur in Boulder, Colorado, wakes up at 5:55 each morning. And if he doesn’t, he has a tweet automatically scheduled that says, “It’s 6:10 and I’m not up because I’m lazy! Reply to this for $5 via PayPal (limit 5), assuming my alarm didn’t malfunction.”

Imagine applying a similar method to your goal of waking up at 5 am every day. You could create a social media post that will automatically publish if you do not check in online by 5:15 am. Considering your desire to build and maintain a professional image, the idea of publicly admitting sleep-in might provide that extra push you need.

We are always trying to present our best selves to the world. We comb our hair and brush our teeth and dress ourselves carefully because we know these habits are likely to get a positive reaction. We want to get good grades and graduate from top schools to impress potential employers and mates and our friends and family. We care about the opinions of those around us because it helps if others like us. This is precisely why getting an accountability partner, or signing a habit contract, can work so well. You value professionalism and punctuality—integrating this with your accountability measures can enhance your personal and professional life significantly.

## Chapter Summary

### HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT

Understanding that you thrive under clear systems and hate feeling inefficient, utilize your strengths in habit formation. By designing systems that make desirable habits inevitable and bad habits impossible, you can efficiently streamline your day. Consider setting specific times for routine tasks and strictly scheduling your deep work periods, reinforcing these with strict boundaries and communication rules about interruptions. Establish an accountability system for daily content creation for social media, potentially collaborating with fellow AI enthusiasts who can keep you committed and innovative. This creates a natural incentive and real-time feedback loop that integrates seamlessly into your ambitious lifestyle and goals, turning your daily practices into powerful habits that propel you towards becoming a successful tech entrepreneur.
**The 1st Law: Make It Obvious**

- 1.1: Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them. For example, noting down when you automatically check social media can help you understand how often and under what circumstances you get distracted.
- 1.2: Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] work on my AI project at [TIME] 6 AM in [LOCATION] my home office.”
- 1.3: Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT] brewing my morning coffee, I will [NEW HABIT] review my visualisation/affirmation board.”
- 1.4: Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible. Keep your gym clothes ready the night before to encourage your workout routine, or have your AI articles and tools on your desktop to begin coding right away.

**The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive**

- 2.1: Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do. For instance, listen to your favorite tech podcast while checking your morning emails.
- 2.2: Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior. Engage more actively in AI and tech entrepreneur online communities where daily deep work and continuous learning are the norm.
- 2.3: Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit. You might start your deep work session by playing a favorite song that gets you into a focused state.

**The 3rd Law: Make It Easy**

- 3.1: Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits. Have your most used AI programming tools easily accessible and ready to go on your computer.
- 3.2: Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier. Organize your home office to minimize distractions and optimize focus—perhaps by having a clean desk and motivational quotes from AI pioneers visible.
- 3.3: Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact, like turning off your phone notifications during deep work periods.
- 3.4: Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less. For example, if you’re struggling to start a complex AI model, commit to writing just one line of code to get the momentum going.
- 3.5: Automate your habits. Invest in technology and one-time purchases that lock in future behavior. Use apps that block distracting websites during your work hours or automate your home appliances to save time.

### The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

- 4.1: Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit. For example, after a productive AI development session, you could allow yourself a quality coffee break.
- 4.2: Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits. If you’re avoiding late-night snacks, organize a morning tasty and nutritious breakfast you look forward to as a reward.
- 4.3: Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.” Mark off days on a calendar where you successfully work on AI projects without social media distractions.
- 4.4: Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately. Missed a 5 AM wakeup? Ensure you’re in bed by 8 PM the next night to reset.

# How To Break A Bad Habit

**Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible**

- 1.5: Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment. For example, delete social media apps from your phone to prevent random checks during work time.

**Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive**

- 2.4: Reframe your mindset. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits. Realize that each time you avoid a social media spiral, you gain valuable time that can be redirected towards your AI projects or personal learning.

**Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult**

- 3.6: Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits. Log out from all social media accounts on your devices to make accessing them more cumbersome, reinforcing your focus on more productive tasks.

**The Truth About Talent (When Genes Matter and When They Don’t)**

Many are familiar with Michael Phelps, who is widely considered to be one of the greatest athletes in history. Phelps has won more Olympic medals not only than any swimmer but also more than any Olympian in any sport.

Fewer people know the name Hicham El Guerrouj, but he was a fantastic athlete in his own right. El Guerrouj is a Moroccan runner who holds two Olympic gold medals and is one of the greatest middle-distance runners of all time. For many years, he held the world record in the mile, 1,500-meter, and 2,000-meter races. At the Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, in 2004, he won gold in the 1,500-meter and 5,000-meter races.

These two athletes are wildly different in many ways. (For starters, one competed on land and the other in water.) But most notably, they differ significantly in height. El Guerrouj is five feet, nine inches tall. Phelps is six feet, four inches tall. Despite this seven-inch difference in height, the two men are identical in one respect: Michael Phelps and Hicham El Guerrouj wear the same length inseam on their pants.

How is this possible? Phelps has relatively short legs for his height and a very long torso, the perfect build for swimming. El Guerrouj has incredibly long legs and a short upper body, an ideal frame for distance running.

Now, apply this concept to your personal aspirations as an AI tech entrepreneur. Just as Phelps and El Guerrouj excelled in sports that leveraged their unique physical attributes, you can channel your technical skills and passion for AI into building a successful business and brand. Your strong background in mathematics and computer science, along with your deep interest in AI, is the equivalent of Phelps’ long torso in swimming. It gives you a natural advantage in the tech field, efficient problem-solving, and applying AI models that others might struggle with.

In your case, success might look like focusing on AI-driven solutions, which requires the precision and analytical skills that align with your training and experience. Every time you use these innate skills, it’s like El Guerrouj running a middle-distance race — you’re putting yourself in a position to succeed by leveraging your natural endowment. Your capability to implement and navigate complex algorithms translates effectively into creating efficient, scalable AI systems, much as Phelps' physique propels him through water.

Just as switching Phelps to distance running or El Guerrouj to swimming would not play to their strengths, diverting your focus to areas outside your AI expertise might slow your progress. Keep this in mind as you aim to minimize distractions and focus deeply on your current strengths. Let your innate skills and passions guide your daily tasks and long-term projects, sustaining motivation and enforcing your personal boundaries to streamline your efforts toward becoming a prominent leader in the AI space.

By recognizing and acting on this alignment in your work, watch how your unique traits don’t just add to your potential but multiply your effectiveness, driving you towards the pinnacle of tech entrepreneurship.
- Doubtful he would ever qualify for the Olympics as a swimmer. Since 1976, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 1,500-meter run is five feet, ten inches. In comparison, the average height of Olympic gold medalists in the men’s 100-meter freestyle swim is six feet, four inches. Swimmers tend to be tall and have long backs and arms, which are ideal for pulling through the water. El Guerrouj would be at a severe disadvantage before he ever touched the pool.

- The secret to maximizing your odds of success is to choose the right field of competition. This is just as true with habit change as it is with sports and business. Habits are easier to perform, and more satisfying to stick with, when they align with your natural inclinations and abilities. Like Michael Phelps in the pool or Hicham El Guerrouj on the track, you want to play a game where the odds are in your favor.

For example, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur deeply engaged in AI and machine learning, you have already established a competitive edge in a highly specialized field. By continuing to strengthen habits related to AI research, problem-solving in technology, and content creation around your projects, you're playing to your strengths much like Phelps uses his physical attributes in swimming.

- Embracing this strategy requires the acceptance of the simple truth that people are born with different abilities. Some people don’t like to discuss this fact. On the surface, your genes seem to be fixed, and it’s no fun to talk about things you cannot control. Plus, phrases like biological determinism make it sound like certain individuals are destined for success and others doomed to failure. But this is a shortsighted view of the influence of genes on behavior.

- The strength of genetics is also their weakness. Genes cannot be easily changed, which means they provide a powerful advantage in favorable circumstances and a serious disadvantage in others. In your case, your prowess in mathematical thinking and programming, honed by years of education and practice, has set you up for success in fields where these skills are invaluable. By focusing your habit formation around enhancing these innate abilities—such as scheduled deep learning practice or regular engagement with peer communities in tech—you leverage your genetic predisposition in a way that aligns with your professional aspirations.

### HOW YOUR PERSONALITY INFLUENCES YOUR HABITS

Your genes are operating beneath the surface of every habit. Indeed, beneath the surface of every behavior. Genes have been shown to influence everything from the number of hours you spend watching television to your likelihood to marry or divorce to your tendency to get addicted to drugs, alcohol, or nicotine. There’s a strong genetic component to how obedient or rebellious you are when facing authority, how vulnerable or resistant you are to stress, and even to some extent, your general outlook on life—be it optimistic or pessimistic.

As an aspiring tech entrepreneur deeply engrossed in the realms of AI and deep learning, your genetic predisposition towards analytical thinking, problem-solving, and perseverance plays a significant role. These traits not only facilitate your engagement with complex programming and algorithm challenges but also influence the habits you form around continuous learning and innovation. Understanding this can help you leverage your natural inclinations to further enhance your effectiveness.

For instance, your natural competence in mathematics and computer science isn't just a result of your education; it is also likely supported by your genetic predispositions which make these activities not only more enjoyable but also deeply satisfying. This is pivotal in maintaining the motivation needed for your daily deep work sessions.

In your day-to-day life, you face the challenge of minimizing distractions to focus on your work and managing routine tasks effectively without feeling drained. Recognizing how your personality impacts your habits can empower you to create an environment that minimizes stress triggers. By structuring your day to accommodate high-focus tasks during your peak productivity periods, and scheduling routine, lower-energy tasks like replying to emails or social media management later, you align your natural abilities with your daily actions, enhancing both satisfaction and output.

Moreover, the habit of waking up at 5 AM can be seen more as a reflection of your disciplined nature, striving for a structured day starting with high-value tasks. By understanding that your natural disposition supports this habit, you can adjust your environment to make waking early easier, such as setting an automatic bedtime mode on your devices to wind down at night or designing a pre-bedtime routine that prepares you for the next day.

Understanding that your genetic makeup can predispose but not predetermine, allows you to create habits that align not only with your ambitions but also with your natural strengths and limitations. This alignment significantly enhances the satisfaction derived from these habits, making them more sustainable in the long run. In essence, by tailoring your habits around your genetic predispositions, you are setting yourself up for a more fulfilling and productive entrepreneurial journey.
You are to stressful events, how proactive or reactive you tend to be, and even how captivated or bored you feel during sensory experiences like attending a concert. As Robert Plomin, a behavioral geneticist at King’s College in London, told me, “It is now at the point where we have stopped testing to see if traits have a genetic component because we literally can’t find a single one that isn’t influenced by our genes.”

Bundled together, your unique cluster of genetic traits predispose you to a particular personality. Your personality is the set of characteristics that is consistent from situation to situation. The most proven scientific analysis of personality traits is known as the “Big Five,” which breaks them down into five spectrums of behavior:

- Openness to experience: from curious and inventive on one end to cautious and consistent on the other. For instance, your creativity and curiosity, evident from your past success in math competitions and your ongoing exploration of AI applications, signify high openness. This trait should empower you to innovate as you build your business and solve complex problems using AI.

- Conscientiousness: organized and efficient to easygoing and spontaneous. As someone who aims to wake up at 5 AM daily and is disciplined about diet and exercise, your high conscientiousness supports habits like meticulous planning and detailed task management, crucial for a successful entrepreneur.

- Extroversion: outgoing and energetic to solitary and reserved. Although tech work often requires long hours of solitary focus, your interest in developing a personal brand through social media suggests balanced extroversion, beneficial for engaging with followers and networking with other experts.

- Agreeableness: friendly and compassionate to challenging and detached. The high agreeableness would enhance your interactions with your girlfriend, collaborators, and online communities, helping to build supportive personal and professional relationships.

- Neuroticism: anxious and sensitive to confident, calm, and stable. Your challenge might lie in managing stress and avoiding burnout, key areas where building habits around recovery and relaxation (like reading in a café or using wellness procedures) can help stabilize your emotional responses.

All five characteristics have biological underpinnings. Extroversion, for instance, can be tracked from birth. If scientists play a loud noise in the nursing ward, some babies turn toward it while others turn away. When the researchers tracked these children through life, they found that the babies who turned toward the noise were more likely to grow up to be extroverts. Those who turned away were more likely to become introverts.

People who are high in agreeableness are kind, considerate, and warm. They also tend to have higher natural oxytocin levels, a hormone that plays an important role in social bonding, increases feelings of trust, and can act as a natural antidepressant. You can easily imagine how someone with more oxytocin might be inclined to build habits like writing thank you notes or maintaining regular check-ins with team members, enhancing teamwork and cooperation in a thriving start-up environment.
- As a third example, consider neuroticism, which is a personality trait all people possess to various degrees. People who are high in neuroticism tend to be anxious and worry more than others. This trait has been linked to hypersensitivity of the amygdala, the portion of the brain responsible for noticing threats. In your case, managing the stress associated with starting a new business in a new city like Dubai might trigger such sensitivities. Being aware of this can help you tailor your environment to mitigate these triggers, such as scheduling regular mindfulness or relaxation exercises to effectively manage stress levels.

- Our habits are not solely determined by our personalities, but there is no doubt that our genes nudge us in a certain direction. Our deeply rooted preferences make certain behaviors easier for some people than for others. You don’t have to apologize for these differences or feel guilty about them, but you do have to work with them. For someone like you, who thrives in a structured environment (like waking at 5 am and starting the day with high-priority tasks), leveraging this trait by designing your day to minimize disruptions (like setting specific "do not disturb" times when working on AI projects) can enhance productivity.

- The takeaway is that you should build habits that work for your personality. For instance, while your workouts are inconsistent in timing, recognizing that you prefer a structured schedule means planning fixed times for your exercise. This not only caters to your disciplined nature but also ensures the habit sticks.

- People can get ripped working out like a bodybuilder, but if you prefer specific types of training like HYROX or runs, then shape your exercise habit around these interests. This aligns with your enjoyment of trying new sports, making the routine more enjoyable and sustainable. If your friends suggest different diet plans, but you find that a mix of protein-rich foods like steak, eggs, and cottage cheese works best for you, stick to what suits your fitness and health goals. It’s about personalizing your approach to fit your lifestyle and preferences.

- If you want to read more, don’t be embarrassed if you prefer technical articles and programming manuals over classic literature or nonfiction. Consume content that motivates you to excel in your field of AI and programming. The more relevant the reading is to your goals, such as learning from AI experts or technological trend articles, the more likely you will maintain this habit.

- There is a version of every habit that can bring you joy and satisfaction. Find it. Habits need to be enjoyable if they are going to stick. For example, blending your love for wellness procedures into your recovery days can transform these from mere schedule fillers into genuinely rejuvenating experiences, making them enjoyable habits that boost your productivity and wellbeing. This alignment fulfills the core idea behind the 4th Law, making the habit both satisfying and integral to your lifestyle.

- Tailoring your habits to your personality is a good strategy to ensure they stick. When applied thoughtfully, habits like structured deep work sessions, scheduled relaxation, and exercise aligned with personal interests not only make a massive difference in productivity but also in overall personal happiness and achievement in the realm of tech entrepreneurship.
# HOW TO FIND A GAME WHERE THE ODDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR

Learning to play a game where the odds are in your favor is critical for maintaining motivation and feeling successful. In theory, you can enjoy almost anything. In practice, you are more likely to enjoy the things that come easily to you. People who are talented in a particular area tend to be more competent at that task and are then praised for doing a good job. They stay energized because they are making progress where others have failed, and because they get rewarded with better pay and bigger opportunities, which not only makes them happier but also propels them to produce even higher-quality work. It’s a virtuous cycle.

- Pick the right habit and progress is easy. Pick the wrong habit and life is a struggle.

How do you pick the right habit? The first step is something we covered in the 3rd Law: make it easy. In many cases, when people pick the wrong habit, it simply means they picked a habit that was too difficult. When a habit is easy, you are more likely to be successful. When you are successful, you are more likely to feel satisfied. However, there is another level to consider. In the long-run, if you continue to advance and improve, any area can become challenging. At some point, you need to make sure you’re playing the right game for your skillset. How do you figure that out?

The most common approach is trial and error. Of course, there’s a problem with this strategy: life is short. You don’t have time to try every career, date every eligible bachelor, or play every musical instrument. Thankfully, there is an effective way to manage this conundrum, and it is known as the explore/exploit trade-off.

In the beginning of a new activity, there should be a period of exploration. In your case, it might be akin to your early university days dabbling in various subjects of computer science and mathematics, dating different project ideas, and internships. This stage should be followed by exploitation, where you leverage your strongest skills. For instance, your technical prowess in AI and machine learning is an area where you have already demonstrated significant competence through your internships and work in algorithmic trading. This makes AI a great playfield where the odds are in your favor due to your background and proven skills.

Just as you have committed to daily workouts to maintain physical fitness, consider similarly structuring your day for mental and entrepreneurial fitness. Avoid the pitfall of simply reacting to the environment and instead thoughtfully exploit your expertise in AI by dedicating blocks of time to deep work without interruptions. 

Further exploiting your strengths could also involve using your technical skills to create content around AI on your YouTube channel, which not only enhances your personal brand but simultaneously reinforces your knowledge and positioned identity as an AI expert.

By continuously refining this approach—sharpening your focus on AI, while also investing time in developing related skills like content creation and public speaking—you ensure that you're not just playing the game, but you’re playing the right game where yours odds of long-term success and satisfaction are tremendously higher.
Certainly! Here’s a personalized revision of the provided book section to align more closely with your aspirations and context as a tech entrepreneur working extensively with AI and striving to cultivate effective habits:

---

In business, particularly in a field as dynamic as tech entrepreneurship, it’s called split testing. The goal is to try out many possibilities, research a broad range of ideas, and cast a wide net.

After this initial period of exploration, shift your focus to the best solution you’ve found—but keep experimenting occasionally. The proper balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you are currently winning, you exploit, exploit, exploit. If you are currently losing, you continue to explore, explore, explore.

In the long-run, it is probably most effective to work on the strategy that seems to deliver the best results about 80 to 90 percent of the time and keep exploring with the remaining 10 to 20 percent. Google, a bastion of tech innovation much like the realms you aspire to dominate, famously asks employees to spend 80 percent of the workweek on their official job and 20 percent on projects of their choice, which has led to the creation of blockbuster products like AdWords and Gmail.

The optimal approach also depends on how much time you have. If you have a lot of time—like someone at the beginning of their career—it makes more sense to explore because once you find the right thing, you still have a good amount of time to exploit it. If you’re pressed for time—say, as you come up on the deadline for a project—you should implement the best solution you’ve found so far and get some results.

As you explore different options, there are a series of questions you can ask yourself to continually narrow in on the habits and areas that will be most satisfying to you:

- What feels like fun to me, but work to others? The mark of whether you are made for a task is not whether you love it but whether you can handle the pain of the task easier than most people. When are you enjoying yourself while other people are complaining? The work that hurts you less than it hurts others is the work you were made to do. Your passion for AI and problem-solving using deep learning could be your sign here. While others may shy away or see the detailed, repetitive nature as daunting, it excites you and fuels your day.

- What makes me lose track of time? Flow is the mental state you enter when you are so focused on the task at hand that the rest of the world fades away. This blend of happiness and peak performance happens when you're coding a new algorithm or scripting the latest content for your YouTube channel on AI innovations. Just like your dedication pushes you into deep work, these times of flow are indicators where your true interest lies.

Personalizing these reflections will not only make your work more productive but also ensure it consistently aligns with your ultimate visions of becoming an influential tech maestro.

### 📒 Summary + Notes

### **🔁 What are habits?**

> Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.
> 

And when we repeat 1% errors, day after day, through replicating poor decisions, duplicating tiny mistakes, and rationalising little excuses, our small choices compound into toxic results.

### **🧑‍⚖️ There are 4 laws of behaviour change that we can use to create good habits and break the bad ones**

A single habit is made of a **cue, craving, response, and reward**. These components form according to the 4 laws of behaviour change:

1. **Make it obvious** – Just like placing your Vitamin D pills in an easy-to-see location increased your usage, organizing your work environment can help you focus better. For example, keeping a clean and dedicated workspace in your home office can streamline your process when you start work every morning, making it effortless to dive right into your most important project of the day.

2. **Make it attractive** – To make hard tasks like content creation or sophisticated AI problem-solving more appealing, you could tie them to an activity you find enjoyable. Perhaps only allow yourself to listen to your favorite podcast while engaging in these challenging tasks, making them more engaging.

3. **Make it easy** – Just as packing your gym bag ahead of time makes it easier to exercise, setting up your work tools and resources the night before can make your morning start-up process smoother and less aversive. This reduces friction and makes it more likely that you'll dive into work without procrastination.

4. **Make it immediately satisfying** – Seeing that you enjoy a spa session after a hard workout, you could create a similar reward system for your work. Perhaps after a long session of deep work, you could have a 10-minute meditation or a brief walk outside. This ties a positive and immediate reward to your effort, which encourages repeat behavior.

### **⏳ It takes time to build a habit or break a bad one and that’s why most people quit halfway**

The principle of the Plateau of Latent Potential can be likened to your experience relocating to Dubai. Just as an ice cube slowly heats until it reaches the melting point, settling into your new city and establishing routines will take patience and persistence before feeling completely 'at home.'

### **⚙️ Adopt a systems-first approach instead of focusing on goals**

You’ve seen how focusing solely on goals without robust systems can lead to sporadic success but not consistent execution. Systems, akin to your daily AI development and content creation, ensure ongoing progress and depth in your preferred domain.

### **🪞 To form good habits, make them a part of your identity**

Identity change is crucial for sustaining habits, similar to how you previously integrated daily affirmations and visualization into your routine. Seeing yourself as a successful entrepreneur or a tech maestro creates a self-image that aligns with your daily actions and long-term aspirations.

**Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack is clarity.** 

By structuring your day to minimize distractions and segment times for deep work, social media, and personal activities, you follow the principle that disciplined environments significantly reduce the need for self-control. Make your work "untouchable" by clear communication with those around you, including your girlfriend, about your work boundaries.

*Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.*

Choosing to engage in AI problem-solving or content creation each day solidifies your identity as an AI expert and influential tech personality. By consistently acting in alignment with this identity, your daily practices powerfully affirm who you are and who you aspire to become.

This personalized approach should help make the concepts in *Atomic Habits* more concrete and applicable to your unique circumstances, enabling you to harness the power of small changes for substantial growth.
When you can’t win by being better, you can win by being different. By combining your skills, you reduce the level of competition, which makes it easier to stand out. You can shortcut the need for a genetic advantage (or for years of practice) by rewriting the rules. A good player works hard to win the game everyone else is playing. A great player creates a new game that favors their strengths and avoids their weaknesses.

For example, in your quest to become a notable tech entrepreneur in the AI space, blending your profound understanding of machine learning with your emerging skills in content creation and personal branding on platforms like Twitter and YouTube stands out. This unique combination not only sets you apart but also plays directly into your strengths—similar to how creating specialized content can make AI principles more approachable and engaging to a broader audience.

In college, I designed my own major, biomechanics, which was a combination of physics, chemistry, biology, and anatomy. I wasn’t smart enough to stand out among the top physics or biology majors, so I created my own game. And because it suited me—I was only taking the courses I was interested in—studying felt like less of a chore. It was also easier to avoid the trap of comparing myself to everyone else. After all, nobody else was taking the same combination of classes, so who could say if they were better or worse?

Similarly, by focusing on integrating your technical expertise with practical, real-world applications and sharing these insights through social media, you're designing your own curriculum. This not only enhances your learning but also ensures that you're engaging with content you're passionate about, thus making the process much more enjoyable and less of a chore.

Specialization is a powerful way to overcome the “accident” of bad genetics. The more you master a specific skill, the harder it becomes for others to compete with you. Many bodybuilders are stronger than the average arm wrestler, but even a massive bodybuilder may lose at arm wrestling because the arm wrestling

champ has very specific strength. Even if you’re not the most naturally gifted, you can often win by being the best in a very narrow category.

Boiling water will soften a potato but harden an egg. You can’t control whether you’re a potato or an egg, but you can decide to play a game where it’s better to be hard or soft. If you can find a more favorable environment, you can transform the situation from one where the odds are against you to one where they are in your favor.

In your case, cultivating a niche in AI-driven solutions for real-world problems offers a 'hardening' effect against the competition. By consistently applying AI to practical issues and sharing this knowledge, you create and rule a niche market. This strategy not only differentiates you but also aligns perfectly with your strengths and passion, turning potential disadvantages into your biggest assets.
### TO GET THE MOST OUT OF YOUR GENES

Our genes do not eliminate the need for hard work. They clarify it. They tell us what to work hard on. Once we realize our strengths, we know where to spend our time and energy. We know which types of opportunities to look for and which types of challenges to avoid. The better we understand our nature, the better our strategy can be.

Biological differences matter. Even so, it’s more productive to focus on whether you are fulfilling your own potential than comparing yourself to someone else. The fact that you have a natural limit to any specific ability has nothing to do with whether you are reaching the ceiling of your capabilities. People get so caught up in the fact that they have limits that they rarely exert the effort required to get close to them.

Furthermore, genes can’t make you successful if you’re not doing the work. Yes, it’s possible that the ripped trainer at the gym has better genes, but if you haven’t put in the same reps, it’s impossible to say if you have been dealt a better or worse genetic hand. Until you work as hard as those you admire, don’t explain away their success as luck. 

For example, in your career as an aspiring tech entrepreneur, deeply involved in the AI and machine learning fields, leveraging your technical skills and background in maths is a perfect match. You’ve naturally excelled in these areas previously, which suggests a strong genetic inclination towards analytical and computational thinking. Hence, focusing and hardening your efforts in these fields could raise your chance of success exponentially.

In summary, one of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills. Work hard on the things that come easy.

### The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work

In 1955, Disneyland had just opened in Anaheim, California, when a ten-year-old boy walked in and asked for a job. Labor laws were loose back then and the boy managed to land a position selling guidebooks for $0.50 apiece.

Within a year, he had transitioned to Disney’s magic shop, where he learned tricks from the older employees. He experimented with jokes and tried out simple routines on visitors. Soon he discovered that what he loved was not performing magic but performing in general. He set his sights on becoming a comedian.

Beginning in his teenage years, he started performing in little clubs around Los Angeles. The crowds were small and his act was short. He was rarely on stage for more than five minutes. Most of the people in the crowd were too busy drinking or talking with friends to pay attention. One night, he literally delivered his standup routine to an empty club.

It wasn’t glamorous work, but there was no doubt he was getting better. His first routines would only last one or two minutes. By high school, his material had expanded to include a five-minute act and, a few years later, a ten-minute show. At nineteen, he was performing weekly for twenty minutes at a time. He had to read three poems during the show just to make the routine long enough, but his skills continued to progress.

He spent another decade experimenting, adjusting, and practicing. He took a job as a television writer and, gradually, he was able to land his own appearances on talk shows. By the mid-1970s, he had worked his way into being a regular guest on The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live.

Finally, after nearly fifteen years of work, the young man rose to fame. He toured sixty cities in sixty-three days. Then seventy-two cities in eighty days. Then eighty-five cities in ninety days. He had 18,695 people attend one show in Ohio. Another 45,000 tickets were sold for his three-day show in Nebraska.

This story resonates strongly with your journey as an aspiring AI tech entrepreneur. Like the young comedian, you started with a deep focus on mathematics and programming, honing your skills through competitions and intensive studies. Your career took you through positions of increasing responsibility, from internships in big tech companies to quantitative research in algorithmic trading using AI.

Now, as you shift towards creating AI solutions for real-world problems and establishing your personal brand, your day-to-day life demands continuous learning, practice, and perseverance—traits shared with the comedian's journey to stardom. His experience of performing in small, sometimes disinterested venues mirrors your early attempts at content creation where immediate engagement might not be massive but is essential for skill improvement and audience building.

Your desire to focus substantially on developing AI solutions and educational content can draw parallels with the comedian's transition from performing magic to mastering comedy, refining his identity and craft along the way. Implementing daily routines that embrace the principles of the Goldilocks Rule—engaging in tasks that are neither too easy nor too hard but are just right—ensures that your progress in AI and personal branding remains consistently challenging and engaging.

Moreover, considering your aspirations to become a well-rounded leader and influencer in the tech space, embracing this story's lessons about persistence, gradual improvement, and adaptation can serve as a motivational framework. Just as the comedian adapted his routines and embraced various platforms from clubs to television, transitioning your skills from coding and algorithmic strategies to content creation and public speaking will likely involve learning curves and the need to stay motivated through challenges.

The Goldilocks Rule ultimately teaches us that sustained effort, when aligned with our passions and abilities, leads to unprecedented levels of success—just as you aspire to achieve with your ventures in AI technology and beyond.
**The Goldilocks Rule: How to Stay Motivated in Life and Work**

The human brain loves a challenge, but only if it is within an optimal zone of difficulty. If you, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur and AI enthusiast, were to tackle a project well below your capabilities—say, a basic programming tutorial—you'd likely disengage quickly due to lack of challenge. Conversely, diving into an advanced quantum computing project without adequate foundational knowledge might leave you feeling overwhelmed and demotivated.

Now consider working on AI projects that balance between what you've mastered and what you aspire to achieve—perhaps developing a new machine learning model that optimally predicts stock trends based on your background in algorithmic trading. As the project progresses, you overcome hurdles and refine your model, experiencing both setbacks and victories. You have a good chance of excelling, but only if you really apply yourself. Your focus narrows, distractions from Twitter or Instagram fade away, and you find yourself fully invested in the task at hand. This is a challenge of just manageable difficulty and it is a prime example of the Goldilocks Rule.

The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.

For you, applying the Goldilocks Rule might involve structuring your AI development cycle or content creation for YouTube in a way that each project incrementally increases in complexity. Start each morning, perhaps right after your routine affirmations, by tackling a segment of your AI project that pushes you slightly beyond your comfort zone. This could be integrating a new dataset or experimenting with a novel algorithm.

Similarly, when producing YouTube content, begin with topics you are comfortable with, but challenge yourself to incorporate advanced editing techniques or deeper dives into complex topics over time. By escalating the difficulty in manageable increments, every video you produce not only enhances your skill set but also keeps your engagement high.

This approach ensures that each day is mentally stimulating and aligned with your ultimate goals of becoming a renowned leader in the AI space. Each task and project becomes a stepping stone not just in your professional journey, but in crafting the very identity you aspire to embody: a tech entrepreneur who is not only successful but deeply knowledgeable and respected in your field.
**THE GOLDILOCKS RULE**

- Not too hard.
- Not too easy.
- Just right.

### MOTIVATION

- BOREDOM
- FAILURE

# Difficulty

![FIGURE 15](image_link): Maximum motivation occurs when facing a challenge of just manageable difficulty. In psychology research, this is known as the Yerkes-Dodson law, which describes the optimal level of arousal as the midpoint between boredom and anxiety.

Your journey as an aspiring tech entrepreneur trying to refine your business model in AI perfectly aligns with the Goldilocks Rule in practice. Each project you undertake expands your routine—but by focusing on incrementally challenging projects, akin to expanding a comedy routine by just a minute or two. This balance ensures you're continuously engaging with new challenges that align with your deep-rooted interest in AI, yet maintaining enough familiarity to secure constant progress and stay motivated.

When you’re starting a new habit, it’s important to keep the behavior as easy as possible so you can stick with it even when conditions aren’t perfect. This concept resonates closely with your approach, particularly when managing your time effectively between AI projects and content creation. By setting foundational habits that start easy, like dedicating the first hour after waking to undistracted deep work on your AI projects, you maintain progress even in less ideal conditions.

Once a habit has been established, however, it’s important to continue to advance in small ways. These incremental improvements and challenges are pivotal for remaining engaged. And when you craft your AI solutions just right, pushing your abilities by approximately 4 percent—enough to stretch your skills without leading to frustration—you cultivate a state of deep immersion or flow in your work.

- The core idea of the Goldilocks Rule remains: working on challenges of just manageable difficulty—something on the perimeter of your ability—seems crucial for maintaining motivation.

- Improvement requires a delicate balance. You need to regularly seek out new technical challenges, whether in applying advanced machine learning techniques or exploring new AI applications, while ensuring steady progress through systematic, continuous improvements in your coding and algorithm development. This strategy not only nurtures your desire to excel in the AI space but also fortifies your position as a leading tech entrepreneur.
### HOW TO STAY FOCUSED WHEN YOU GET BORED WORKING ON YOUR GOALS

After my baseball career ended, I was looking for a new sport. I joined a weightlifting team and one day an elite coach visited our gym. He had worked with thousands of athletes during his long career, including a few Olympians. I introduced myself and we began talking about the process of improvement.

“What’s the difference between the best athletes and everyone else?” I asked. “What do the really successful people do that most don’t?”

He mentioned the factors you might expect: genetics, luck, talent. But then he said something I wasn’t expecting: “At some point it comes down to who can handle the boredom of training every day, doing the same lifts over and over and over.”

His answer surprised me because it’s a different way of thinking about work ethic. People talk about getting “amped up” to work on their goals. Whether it’s business or sports or art, you hear people say things like, “It all comes down to passion.” Or, “You have to really want it.” As a result, many of us get depressed when we lose focus or motivation because we think that successful people have some bottomless reserve of passion. But this coach was saying that really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.

Mastery requires practice. But the more you practice something, the more boring and routine it becomes. Once the beginner gains have been made and we learn what to expect, our interest starts to fade. Sometimes it happens even faster than that. All you have to do is hit the gym a few days in a row or publish a couple of blog posts on time and letting one day slip doesn’t feel like much. Things are going well for you as a burgeoning tech entrepreneur working on AI projects and content creation. Yet, the daily grind of coding, algorithm tweaking, and content editing can become mundane. But just like the elite athletes, your ability to handle this boredom and consistently apply yourself to these essential tasks is what will differentiate you from the rest in the fiercely competitive tech industry. Your commitment to waking up at 5 am for focused work sessions, despite how repetitive it might feel, plays a crucial role in your journey towards becoming a legendary tech maestro.
It’s easy to rationalize taking a day off because you’re in a good place.

The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom. We get bored with habits because they stop delighting us. The outcome becomes expected. And as our habits become ordinary, we start derailing our progress to seek novelty. For you, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur deeply passionate about AI and content creation, this principle is vital in maintaining your daily discipline. Just as you strive to innovate in your work, maintaining novelty in your habits—such as varying your workout routines or mixing up your learning modalities with books, audiobooks, and interactive content—can keep you engaged.

Perhaps this is why we get caught up in a never-ending cycle, jumping from one workout to the next, one diet to the next, one business idea to the next. As soon as we experience the slightest dip in motivation, we begin seeking a new strategy—even if the old one was still working. As Machiavelli noted, "Men desire novelty to such an extent that those who are doing well wish for a change as much as those who are doing badly." This is particularly relevant to your journey, where the thrill of tackling new AI problems or exploring fresh business models might lead you to periodically pivot or adjust your focus, harnessing this desire for novelty constructively.

Perhaps this is why many of the most habit-forming products are those that provide continuous forms of novelty. Video games provide visual novelty. Porn provides sexual novelty. Junk foods provide culinary novelty. Each of these experiences offer continual elements of surprise. 

In your case, rotating your focus among different interests like AI, programming, and content creation offers a way to add novelty to your day-to-day routines while maintaining progress toward your overarching goals of becoming a prominent tech entrepreneur and AI expert.

In psychology, this is known as a variable reward. Slot machines are the most common real-world example. A gambler hits the jackpot every now and then but not at any predictable interval. The pace of rewards varies. This variance leads to the greatest spike of dopamine, enhances memory recall, and accelerates habit formation.

Variable rewards won’t create a craving—that is, you can’t take a reward people are uninterested in, give it to them at a variable interval, and hope it will change their mind—but they are a powerful way to amplify the cravings we already experience because they reduce boredom. 

In your entrepreneurial journey and personal development, applying this concept might look like varying your learning and content production schedule. Not every video or coding session must result in a breakthrough or viral content. Still, the unpredictable “wins” of a successful post or a coding problem solved can drive your engagement and motivation.

The sweet spot of desire occurs at a 50/50 split between success and failure. Half of the time you get what you want. Half of the time you don’t. You need just enough “winning” to experience satisfaction and just enough “wanting” to experience desire. This is one of the benefits of following the Goldilocks Rule. If you’re already interested in a habit, working on challenges at the edge of your abilities, such as sophisticated AI models or complex content strategies, enhances both engagement and capability, sustaining your long-term growth and achievement in the dynamic tech landscape.
Of course, not all habits have a variable reward component, and you wouldn't want them to. If Google only delivered a useful search result some of the time, I would switch to a competitor pretty quickly. If Uber only picked up half of my trips, I doubt I’d be using that service much longer. And if I flossed my teeth each night and only sometimes ended up with a clean mouth, I think I’d skip it.

Variable rewards or not, no habit will stay interesting forever. At some point, everyone faces the same challenge on the journey of self-improvement: you have to fall in love with boredom.

We all have goals that we would like to achieve and dreams that we would like to fulfill, but it doesn’t matter what you are trying to become better at, if you only do the work when it’s convenient or exciting, then you’ll never be:

- Consistent enough to achieve remarkable results.

I can guarantee that if you manage to start a habit and keep sticking to it, there will be days when you feel like quitting. When you start a business, there will be days when you don’t feel like showing up. For example, as a burgeoning AI tech entrepreneur living in Dubai, you may find those early mornings when the excitement has diminished, and you’re faced with mundane tasks like debugging code or managing datasets - it can feel less appealing to dive into work.

When you’re at the gym, there will be sets that you don’t feel like finishing. This mirrors those moments you describe in your routine, where despite a commitment to physical fitness, the daily grind of workout can sometimes seem less thrilling.

When it’s time to write, there will be days that you don’t feel like typing. This is much like your experience with content creation for YouTube and posting on social media, where the novelty of producing content wears off, yet it's essential for building your personal brand and establishing yourself as an AI expert.

But stepping up when it’s annoying or painful or draining to do so, that’s what makes the difference between a professional and an amateur.

Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way. Take your aim to wake up at 5 am and manage the distractions effectively - professionals find ways to maintain these habits even when external influences, such as living with a partner or adjusting to a new city, might disrupt them.

Professionals know what is important to them and work toward it with purpose; amateurs get pulled off the course by the urgencies of life. Your clear set goals and systematic approach to integrating AI solutions in real-world problems exemplify this professional mindset.

David Cain, an author and meditation teacher, encourages his students to avoid being “fair-weather meditators.” Similarly, you don’t want to be a fair-weather athlete or a fair-weather writer or a fair-weather anything. When a habit is truly important to you, you have to be willing to stick to it in any mood. As you continue to forge your path in the tech world, this resilience will be crucial in maintaining the cycles of productivity and creativity necessary for your success.

Professionals take action even when the mood isn’t right. They might not enjoy it, but they find a way to put the reps in. Whether it’s tackling a complex AI problem, managing your rigorous workout schedule, or dedicating time to learning and self-improvement, the commitment to professionalism remains paramount in your journey to becoming a legendary tech maestro.
## Chapter Summary

- The Goldilocks Rule states that humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities.
- The greatest threat to success is not failure but boredom.
- As habits become routine, they become less interesting and less satisfying. We get bored.
- Anyone can work hard when they feel motivated. It’s the ability to keep going when work isn’t exciting that makes the difference.
- Professionals stick to the schedule; amateurs let life get in the way.

**The Downside of Creating Good Habits**

Creating the foundation for mastery. In chess, much like in your specific endeavors with artificial intelligence and tech entrepreneurship, it is only after the basic movements of the pieces have become automatic that a player can focus on the next level of the game. Each chunk of information that is memorized opens up the mental space for more effortful thinking. This is true for any endeavor. When you know the simple movements so well that you can perform them without thinking, you are free to pay attention to more advanced details. In this way, habits are the backbone of any pursuit of excellence.

However, the benefits of habits come at a cost. At first, each repetition develops fluency, speed, and skill. But then, as a habit becomes automatic, you become less sensitive to feedback. You fall into mindless repetition in similar ways you experience when managing routine tasks or social media checks. It becomes easier to let mistakes slide when you're coding or trying to adhere to your desired 5 am wake-up time. When you can do it "good enough" on automatic, this can lead to stagnation, mirroring your feeling when sticking to workouts feels less motivating over time.
The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside of habits is that you get used to doing things a certain way and stop paying attention to little errors. You assume you're getting better because you're gaining experience. In reality, you are merely reinforcing your current habits—not improving them. In fact, some research has shown that once a skill has been mastered there is usually a slight decline in performance over time.

Usually, this minor dip in performance is no cause for worry. You don't need a system to continuously improve how well you brush your teeth or tie your shoes or make your morning cup of tea. With habits like these, good enough is usually good enough. The less energy you spend on trivial choices, the more you can spend it on what really matters.

However, when you want to maximize your potential and achieve elite levels of performance, you need a more nuanced approach. You can't repeat the same things blindly and expect to become exceptional. Habits are necessary, but not sufficient for mastery. What you need is a combination of automatic habits and...

- Deliberate practice.
  
**Habits + Deliberate Practice = Mastery**

To become great, certain skills do need to become automatic. For example, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur, you might need to make your morning routine of reviewing AI algorithms automatic, thus allowing your mind to focus on solving higher-order problems within your projects. Just as basketball players need to be able to dribble without thinking before they can move on to mastering layups with their nondominant hand, you need to automate your foundational knowledge of coding and algorithms so you can innovate on top of that base.

Surgeons need to repeat the first incision so many times that they could do it with their eyes closed, so that they can focus on the hundreds of variables that arise during surgery. Similarly, in your case, mastering the basic setup for a new AI model should become second nature, enabling you to concentrate on fine-tuning and innovatively applying the model to solve real-world problems more effectively.

But after one habit has been mastered, you have to return to the effortful part of the work and begin building the next habit.

Mastery is the process of narrowing your focus to a tiny element of success, repeating it until you have internalized the skill, and then using this new habit as the foundation to advance to the next frontier of your development. For instance, once you've automated the process of setting up your work environment each day (getting up at 5 am, starting with deep work, minimizing distractions), you can focus more on the fine aspects of AI project development or creating more engaging content for your YouTube channel.

Old tasks become the solid ground from which you propel yourself towards newer, bigger challenges. This progression is seen in how you've managed to go from studying and winning math competitions to applying machine learning to real-world situations—each requiring a level of mastery before moving to the next.
# Skill

**REPETITIONS**

**FIGURE 16:** The process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.

Although habits are powerful, what you need is a way to remain conscious of your performance over time, so you can continue to refine and improve. It is precisely at the moment when you begin to feel like you have mastered a skill—right when things are starting to feel automatic and you are becoming comfortable—that you must avoid slipping into the trap of complacency.

For example, as you've experienced with your expanding commitments in AI and content creation, just as one project nears competence and ease—perhaps automating parts of your algorithmic trading models—you face new challenges that demand a similar cycle of mastery, such as producing high-quality, engaging AI content for your YouTube channel. This ongoing progression requires maintaining a keen awareness of your growth and areas of potential.

The solution? Establish a system for reflection and review.

**HOW TO REVIEW YOUR HABITS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS**

In 1986, the Los Angeles Lakers had one of the most talented basketball teams ever assembled, but they are rarely remembered that way. The team started the 1985-1986 NBA season with an astounding 29-5 record. “The pundits were saying that we might be the best team in the history of basketball,” head coach Pat Riley said after the season. Surprisingly, the Lakers stumbled in the 1986 playoffs and suffered a season-ending defeat in the Western Conference Finals. The “best team in the history of basketball” didn’t even play for the NBA championship.

After that blow, Riley was tired of hearing about how much talent his players had and about how much promise his team held. He didn’t want to see flashes of brilliance followed by a gradual fade in performance. He wanted the Lakers to

- Play up to their potential, night after night. In the summer of 1986, he created a plan to do exactly that, a system that he called the Career Best Effort program or **CBE**.

The CBE system is a powerful model that you can adapt to your scenario. Imagine applying a similar system where each coding session, each content creation project, or even daily routines like your morning affirmations and workouts are evaluated on whether they meet your personal 'Career Best Effort'. This kind of evaluation and conscious observation could help maintain a high standard across the different spheres of your ambitious lifestyle, ensuring that as one project reaches a level of automaticity, you carry forward the same zeal to the newer challenges like mastering the nuances of social media engagement or optimizing your AI models even further. Regular check-ins on your system performance can ensure that every action pushes you towards becoming that legendary Maestro in AI, admired leader, and balanced individual you aspire to be.

End of rewritten text.
- “When players first join the Lakers,” Riley explained, “we track their basketball statistics all the way back to high school. I call this Taking Their Number. We look for an accurate gauge of what a player can do, then build him into our plan for the team, based on the notion that he will maintain and then improve upon his averages.”

- After determining a player’s baseline level of performance, Riley added a key step. He asked each player to “improve their output by at least 1 percent over the course of the season. If they succeeded, it would be a CBE, or Career Best Effort.” This approach parallels your goal in tech entrepreneurship, particularly in the AI field where iterative improvements on your code or algorithms can lead to significant breakthroughs over time.

- Riley was careful to point out that CBE was not merely about points or statistics but about giving your “best effort spiritually and mentally and physically.” Similarly, for you, it’s not just about pushing out more AI models or content but about engaging effectively with your professional community, maintaining your personal well-being, and fostering strong relationships with loved ones like Anastasiia.

- As an example, let’s say that Magic Johnson—the Lakers star player at the time—had 11 points, 8 rebounds, 12 assists, 2 steals, and 5 turnovers in a game. Magic also got credit for an “unsung hero” deed by diving after a loose ball (+1). Finally, he played a total of 33 minutes in this imaginary game.

- The positive numbers (11 + 8 + 12 + 2 + 1) add up to 34. Then, we subtract the 5 turnovers (34—5) to get 29. Finally, we divide 29 by 33 minutes played. 29/33 = 0.879

- Magic’s CBE number here would be 879. This number was calculated for all of a player’s games, and it was the average CBE that a player was asked to improve by 1 percent over the season. In your case, imagine tracking your key productivity metrics: lines of code written, hours spent on machine learning research, AI models developed, and content produced. Subtract from this your distractions, such as time spent unproductively on social media. Then, like Magic, you could strive to improve your output by 1 percent, aligning your daily habits towards becoming a maestro in the AI space and an influential tech entrepreneur.
- Sportswriter Jackie MacMullan noted, “Riley trumpeted the top performers in the league in bold lettering on the blackboard each week and measured them."

- Against the corresponding players on his own roster, solid, reliable players generally rated a score in the 600s, while elite players scored at least 800. Magic Johnson, who submitted 138 triple-doubles in his career, often scored over 1,000.

- The Lakers also emphasized year-over-year progress by making historical comparisons of CBE data. Riley said, “We stacked the month of November 1986, next to November 1985, and showed the players whether they were doing better or worse than at the same point last season. Then we showed them how their performance figures for December 1986 stacked up against November’s.”

- The Lakers rolled out CBE in October 1986. Eight months later, they were NBA champions. The following year, Pat Riley led his team to another title as the Lakers became the first team in twenty years to win back-to-back NBA championships. Afterward, he said, “Sustaining an effort is the most important thing for any enterprise. The way to be successful is to learn how to do things right, then do them the same way every time.”

- The CBE program is a prime example of the power of reflection and review. The Lakers were already talented. CBE helped them get the most out of what they had and made sure their habits improved rather than declined.

- As an aspiring tech entrepreneur recently relocated to Dubai, it's crucial for you, similar to the Lakers, to utilize reflection and review to continually enhance your system. You can integrate this by periodically evaluating your AI project developments against your previous outputs. Just as the Lakers did, you could compare your productivity and learning milestones monthly to ensure consistent progress and adapt your strategies.

- Reflection and review enable the long-term improvement of all habits because it makes you aware of your mistakes and helps you consider possible paths for improvement. Without reflection, we can make excuses, create rationalizations, and lie to ourselves. We have no process for determining whether we are performing better or worse compared to yesterday.

- Top performers in all fields engage in various types of reflection and review, and the process can be directly applied to your routine of developing and managing AI projects. For example, assessing weekly the time spent on machine learning tasks versus content creation will provide concrete data to adjust focus areas. Further, by tracking the engagement and feedback on your social media posts, you can fine-tune your content to better serve and grow your audience effectively, enhancing both your personal brand and your business's reach.

Improvement doesn't have to be complex. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge, one of the greatest marathoners of all time and an Olympic gold medalist, still takes notes after every practice. He reviews his training for the day and searches for areas that can be improved. Similarly, gold medal swimmer Katie Ledecky records her wellness on a scale of 1 to 10, including notes on her nutrition and how well she slept. She also records the times posted by other swimmers. At the end of each week, her coach goes over her notes and adds his thoughts.

- It's not just athletes, either. When you, as a tech entrepreneur, are perfecting your AI projects, adopting a practice similar to that of comedian Chris Rock could be beneficial. Rock tests hundreds of jokes in small nightclubs, noting reactions, before selecting the best for his shows. In your case, this could translate to testing features or algorithms in controlled environments, gathering user feedback, and iterating based on the responses, refining the offering in a methodical way before full-scale deployment.

- Consider also executives and investors who maintain a "decision journal," a practice that could significantly benefit your entrepreneurial ventures. In this journal, document major decisions related to your AI projects, noting why those decisions were made and the expected outcomes. Regularly review these entries to analyze decision-making patterns and outcomes, enhancing your strategic thinking and minimizing potential oversights.

Improvement is not just about establishing habits; it's crucial to continually refine them through reflection and review, ensuring time is spent on the right activities and making necessary adjustments. You shouldn’t persist with a habit that proves to be ineffective, especially in the fast-evolving field of technology and AI.

Personally, I employ two primary modes of reflection and review, which I recommend incorporating into your routine. Each December, I perform an Annual Review, where I reflect on the past year. You could adopt this practice by tallying your achievements—number of AI prototypes developed, content pieces created, or new coding techniques learned. Then, assess your progress by answering three questions:

- What went well this year in your personal development and AI ventures?
- What didn’t go so well in managing your time and balancing life and work?
- What d
Six months later, when summer rolls around, I conduct an Integrity Report. Like everyone, I make a lot of mistakes. My Integrity Report helps me realize where I went wrong and motivates me to get back on course. I use it as a time to revisit my core values and consider whether I have been living in accordance with them. This is when I reflect on my identity and how I can work toward being the type of person I wish to become.

My yearly Integrity Report answers three questions:

- What are the core values that drive my life and work?
- How am I living and working with integrity right now?
- How can I set a higher standard in the future?

These two reports don’t take very long—just a few hours per year—but they are crucial periods of refinement. They prevent the gradual slide that happens when I don’t pay close attention. They provide an annual reminder to revisit my desired identity and consider how my habits are helping me become the type of person I wish to be. They indicate when I should upgrade my habits and take on new challenges and when I should dial my efforts back and focus on the fundamentals.

Reflection can also bring a sense of perspective. Daily habits are powerful because of how they compound, but worrying too much about every daily choice is like looking at yourself in the mirror from an inch away. You can see every imperfection and lose sight of the bigger picture. There is too much feedback. Conversely, never reviewing your habits is like never looking in the mirror. You aren't aware of easily fixable flaws—a spot on your shirt, a bit of food in your teeth. There is too little feedback. Periodic reflection and review is like viewing yourself in the mirror from a conversational distance. You can see the important changes you should make without losing sight of the bigger picture. You want to view the entire mountain range, not obsess over each peak and valley.

Finally, reflection and review offer an ideal time to revisit one of the most important aspects of habit formation—identity-shaping. For instance, as an aspiring tech entrepreneur constantly striving for personal and professional excellence, these moments allow me to ensure my actions align with the vision of being a ground-breaking leader in the AI space. Whether I'm working on AI projects, producing content, or managing lifestyle habits such as waking up early and exercising, each reflects and shapes my identity as a disciplined, innovative, and healthy individual. As I navigate my new environment in Dubai, reflecting on these habits helps me adjust and adapt more effectively to maintaining productivity and personal well-being.
### HOW TO BREAK THE BELIEFS THAT HOLD YOU BACK

In the beginning, repeating a habit is essential to build up evidence of your desired identity. As you latch on to that new identity, however, those same beliefs can hold you back from the next level of growth. When working against you, your identity creates a kind of "pride" that encourages you to deny your weak spots and prevents you from truly growing. This is one of the greatest downsides of building habits.

The more sacred an idea is to us—that is, the more deeply it is tied to our identity—the more strongly we will defend it against criticism. You see this in every industry. The tech entrepreneur who dismisses newer, agile methodologies because they are set in their old programming way—the way that won them their first coding competition. The AI researcher who dismisses emerging tools because they are not part of the traditional deep learning environments. The seasoned content creator who sticks to their usual editing styles, despite new formats gaining popularity, potentially causing them to miss out on broader engagement.

One solution is to avoid making any single aspect of your identity an overwhelming portion of who you are. In the words of investor Paul Graham, "keep your identity small." The more you let a single belief define you, the less capable you are of adapting when life challenges you. If you set your identity solely around being a deep learning engineer, what happens when AI shifts dramatically towards new paradigms that require different expertise?

For most of my young life, being an athlete was a major part of my identity. Here’s how this parallels with your situation: You had set your identity around being a quantitative researcher, focusing on algorithmic trading in your early career. When you decided to pivot and start building your brand as a tech entrepreneur, focusing on AI solutions and sharing knowledge through social media, it required a significant identity shift.

After my baseball career ended, I struggled to find myself. When you spend your whole life defining yourself in one way and that disappears, who are you now? Similarly, after your shift from algorithmic trading to a budding tech entrepreneur, there's a phase of transition. You're not just a tech expert anymore; you're a content creator, a communicator, and an innovator in the AI space. This requires embracing a broader identity, which can be challenging but is also incredibly rewarding as it opens up numerous avenues for growth and learning.
ary veterans and former entrepreneurs report similar feelings. If your identity is wrapped up in a belief like “I’m a great soldier,” what happens when your period of service ends? For many business owners, their identity is something along the lines of “I’m the CEO” or “I’m the founder.” If you have spent every waking moment working on your business, how will you feel after you sell the company?

The key to mitigating these losses of identity is to redefine yourself such that you get to keep important aspects of your identity even if your particular role changes.

- “I’m an athlete” becomes “I’m the type of person who is mentally tough and loves a physical challenge.”
- “I’m a great soldier” transforms into “I’m the type of person who is disciplined, reliable, and great on a team.”
- “I’m the CEO” translates to “I’m the type of person who builds and creates things.”

Think of your own journey, progressing from a technically skilled individual working for others to an aspiring tech entrepreneur seeking to carve out your own niche in the AI field. Your sense of self needs to evolve from "I'm a deep learning engineer" to "I’m someone who solves real-world problems using AI", thus embracing the fluid nature of your career and identity.

### The following quote from the Tao Te Ching encapsulates the ideas perfectly

Men are born soft and supple;
dead, they are stiff and hard.
Plants are born tender and pliant;
dead, they are brittle and dry.
Thus whoever is stiff and inflexible
is a disciple of death.
Whoever is soft and yielding
is a disciple of life.
The hard and stiff will be broken.
The soft and supple will prevail.

- Lao Tzu

In your case, as you navigate the complexities of establishing a startup in Dubai—a new environment—being adaptable is crucial. Your previous patterns, like intensive focus sessions late into the night, might not be as effective in this new stage of your life where early mornings are key. Adapting your method to fit your goal of waking at 5 am is a more sustainable approach.

Habits deliver numerous benefits, but the downside is that they can lock us into our previous patterns of thinking and acting—even when the world is shifting around us. Everything is impermanent. Life is constantly changing, so you need to periodically check in to see if your old habits and beliefs are still serving you.

A lack of self-awareness is poison. Reflection and review are the antidote. Take time to reflect on how your new environment in Dubai impacts your productivity and lifestyle, and adjust your habits accordingly. For instance, scheduling deep work sessions when you and your girlfriend Anastasiia are least likely to distract each other can help maintain the integrity of your workspace at home.

## Chapter Summary

- The upside of habits is that we can do things without thinking. The downside is that we stop paying attention to whether our actions still serve us in changing circumstances. Regular reflection, like reviewing your visualisation/affirmation board which you've neglected recently, ensures that your habits continuously align with your evolving identity as a tech entrepreneur and content creator. Remember, adaptive identity and proactive reflection foster resilience and sustained success.

## Conclusion

### The Secret to Results That Last

- **The Sorites Paradox and Your Life as a Tech Entrepreneur**: The ancient Greek parable known as the Sorites Paradox illustrates the surprising impact of small actions accumulated over time. Consider this: Can one coin make a person rich? If you give a person a pile of ten coins, you wouldn’t claim they are rich. But what if you add another? And another? Suddenly, coin by coin, you are building wealth. Similarly, ask yourself if a single small change, such as waking at 5 a.m. each day to focus deeply on AI development without distractions, can transform your entrepreneurial journey. Initially, it might seem insignificant. Yet, stacking this habit with consistent content creation for your YouTube channel and disciplined personal growth efforts will incrementally tilt the scales towards becoming a prominent tech entrepreneur.

- **Atomic Habits and Your Aspiration to Mastery**: Just as the Sorites Paradox demonstrates the power of accumulation, your journey from tech enthusiast to a renowned AI expert hinges on compiling a vast array of atomic habits. Each habit you adopt, like dedicating time daily to advance your understanding of machine learning or regularly engaging with other AI professionals, may seem trivial on its own. However, cumulative effects of these habits can lead you to a tipping point whereby your expertise and influence in the tech community could expand significantly.

- **Navigating the Problem of Immediate Impact**: In the beginning, small improvements, such as refining your morning routine to ensure distraction-free work hours or setting up systematic weekly planning for content creation and AI projects, can often seem inconsequential because their benefits are not immediately palpable. For example, spending an hour less on social media daily might not show immediate boosts in productivity, but over weeks, you'll gain extra hours to invest in your craft or personal growth.

- **Tipping Point to Habitual Success**: Gradually, as you layer these small adjustments—optimizing your workspace for minimal distractions, scheduling regular check-ins with your accountability group, or ensuring consistent, healthy eating and exercise routines—the scales of life start to shift in your favor. Every new disciplined day adds a grain of sand to the side of productivity and success.

- **Leverage the Weight of Systems**: Eventually, the cumulative weight of your improved systems and habits begins working for you, not against you. This might manifest as your natural wake time aligning closer to 5 a.m., finding more joy and less stress in content creation, or naturally declining less important tasks in favor of high-impact activities. The systems you've built allow you to sustain high productivity levels and innovative thinking in the AI space.

- **The Ripple Effect of Atomic Habits in Your Life**: Consistent application of these principles means that a day of programming, a session of brainstorming for YouTube content, or a morning review of your vision board isn't just another day—it's a crucial part of a compounding process. Each effort reinforces your identity as a disciplined tech entrepreneur and a thought leader in the AI community, gradually transforming your life and enabling you to reach—and even surpass—your goal of making $1,000,000 in monthly profit through your AI solutions and personal brand.

By understanding and applying the principles of the Sorites Paradox to your atomic habits, each small step you take is not just a move towards a specific goal, but a foundational building block in the grand structure of your entrepreneurial and personal aspirations.
- Each of the people, teams, and companies we have covered has faced different circumstances, but ultimately progressed in the same way: through a commitment to tiny, sustainable, unrelenting improvements.

Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine. In Chapter 1, I said, “If you’re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn’t you. The problem is your system. Bad habits repeat themselves again and again not because you don’t want to change, but because you have the wrong system for change.”

As this book draws to a close, I hope the opposite is true. With the Four Laws of Behavior Change, you have a set of tools and strategies that you can use to build better systems and shape better habits. Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you’ll need to make it obvious. Other times you won’t feel like starting and you’ll need to make it attractive. In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you’ll need to make it easy. And sometimes, you won’t feel like sticking with it and you’ll need to make it satisfying.

- Behaviors are effortless here. Behaviors are difficult here.
- Obvious Invisible
- Attractive Unattractive
- Easy Hard
- Satisfying Unsatisfying

You want to push your good habits toward the left side of the spectrum by making them obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. Meanwhile, you want to cluster your bad habits toward the right side by making them invisible, unattractive, hard, and unsatisfying.

This is a continuous process. There is no finish line. There is no permanent solution. Whenever you’re looking to improve, you can rotate through the Four Laws of Behavior Change until you find the optimal setup that fits your entrepreneurial and AI-focused lifestyle. Take the example of aligning your habit to wake at 5 am with making it satisfying by following it with a beloved morning ritual, such as a focused AI project development session or a calm reading period, making use of that peak morning mental clarity. This tailored approach ensures that each habit supports your ultimate identity as a legendary AI entrepreneur and tech maestro. Keep iterating this approach with each habit and component of your life, pulling you closer to the lifestyle you envision with Anastasiia, free from distractions, enriched with meaningful work, and precisely balanced with wellness and personal growth.
next bottleneck. Make it obvious. Make it attractive. Make it easy. Make it satisfying. Round and round. Always looking for the next way to get 1 percent better.

The secret to getting results that last is to never stop making improvements. It’s remarkable what you can build if you just don’t stop. It’s remarkable the business you can build if you don’t stop working on AI solutions or creating engaging YouTube content that simplifies complex tech ideas. It’s remarkable the body you can build if you don’t stop training at your scheduled workout time each day, reinforcing your identity as a committed athlete. It’s remarkable the knowledge you can build if you don’t stop absorbing information from each AI project and the insights you gain from connecting with other experts in your online community. It’s remarkable the fortune you can build if you don’t stop refining your business model and effectively monetizing your profound tech expertise. It’s remarkable the relationships you can build if you don’t stop caring and making time for your girlfriend Anastasiia, your family, and your key business contacts.

Small habits don’t add up. They compound.

That’s the power of atomic habits. Tiny changes in your daily routine, like turning off your phone to eliminate social media distractions until 1 pm, strategically organizing your day to prioritize high-level AI work, or consistently preparing and engaging with your visualisation/affirmation board, lead to remarkable results. Your approach to habit formation not only enhances your personal efficacy but also extends to your professional achievements, reinforcing your identity as a groundbreaking tech entrepreneur and a thoughtful partner.
